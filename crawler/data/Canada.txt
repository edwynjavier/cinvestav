Agency Copyright Notice Previous Next The World Factbook × North America :: CANADA Introduction :: CANADA Background: A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867, while retaining ties to the British crown.
Canada faces the political challenges of meeting public demands for quality improvements in health care, education, social services, and economic competitiveness, as well as responding to the particular concerns of predominantly francophone Quebec.
Canada also aims to develop its diverse energy resources while maintaining its commitment to the environment.

In addition, the country's petroleum sector is rapidly expanding, because Alberta's oil sands significantly boosted Canada's proven oil reserves.
Canada now ranks third in the world in proved oil reserves behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and is the world’s fifth-largest oil producer.
The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US, its principal trading partner.
Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US, which absorbs about three-fourths of Canadian merchandise exports each year.
Canada is the US's largest foreign supplier of energy, including oil, gas, and electric power, and a top source of US uranium imports.
Given its abundant natural resources, highly skilled labor force, and modern capital plant, Canada enjoyed solid economic growth from 1993 through 2007.
Canada's major banks, however, emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to the early intervention by the Bank of Canada and the financial sector's tradition of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization.
Canada achieved marginal growth in 2010-15, despite the recent drop in oil prices.

Canada ( i / ˈ k æ n ə d ə / ; French : [ka.na.dɑ] ) is a country in the northern half of North America.
Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border.
Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains .
Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples .
Beginning in the 16th century, British and French claims were made on the area, with the colony of Canada first being established by the French in 1537.
As a consequence of various conflicts , the United Kingdom gained and lost territories within British North America until it was left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today.
Pursuant to the British North America Act , on July 1, 1867, the colonies of Canada , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia joined to form the semi-autonomous federal Dominion of Canada.
This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada.
In 1931, Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931 , and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 1982 removed the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom .
Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy , with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state.
Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.
Canada is a developed country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally as well as the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index .
Canada is a Commonwealth realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations , a member of the Francophonie , and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the G8 , the Group of Ten , the G20 , the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

[13] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village, but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); [13] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the St Lawrence River as Canada .
[13] From the 16th to the early 18th century " Canada " referred to the part of New France that lay along the St. Lawrence River .
[14] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named The Canadas ; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.
[15] Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country, and the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title.
[16] The transition away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act , which refers only to Canada .
Later that year, the name of national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day .
[18] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Canada See also: Timeline of Canadian history and List of years in Canada Further information: Historiography of Canada Aboriginal peoples [ edit ] Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples at the time of European contact.
Aboriginal peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations , Inuit , and Métis , [19] the latter being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations and Inuit people married European settlers.
[21] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.
[26] The Aboriginal population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 [27] and two million, [28] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples .
[29] As a consequence of contact with European diseases, Canada's Aboriginal peoples suffered from repeated outbreaks of newly introduced infectious diseases, such as influenza , measles , and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), resulting in a forty to eighty percent population decrease in the centuries after the European arrival.
[34] A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Canadian government.
[35] European colonization [ edit ] The first known attempt at European colonization began when Norsemen settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland around 1000 AD. [36] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England .
[39] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Saint Lawrence River , where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words "Long Live the King of France" and took possession of the territory (known as the colony of Canada ) in the name of King Francis I .
[40] In general the settlements appear to have been short-lived, possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in Scandinavia and northern Canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that time.
[47] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and the 1763 Treaty of Paris ceded Canada and most of New France to Britain after the Seven Years' War.
To accommodate English-speaking Loyalists in Quebec, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec ) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario ), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.
[52] A copy of Robert Harris 's Fathers of Confederation (1884), an amalgamation of the Charlottetown and Quebec conferences of 1864 The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and Britain.
[54] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 per cent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.
[17] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849.
[56] Confederation and expansion [ edit ] An animated map showing the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation in 1867 Following several constitutional conferences, the 1867 Constitution Act officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario , Quebec, Nova Scotia , and New Brunswick .
[57] [58] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories , where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.
[60] Early 20th century [ edit ] Canadian soldiers and a Mark II tank at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the Confederation Act, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World War I .
[66] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain, [64] and the 1931 Statute of Westminster affirmed Canada's independence.
[4] Canadian crew of a Sherman tank, south of Vaucelles , France, during the battle of Normandy in June 1944 The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.
The delay underscored Canada's independence.
[64] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany .
[70] The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union .
[64] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.
After two bitter referendums , Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.
[72] At Rideau Hall , Governor General the Viscount Alexander of Tunis (centre) receives the bill finalizing the union of Newfoundland and Canada on March 31, 1949 Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity , marked by the adoption of the current Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, [73] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, [74] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.
[75] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare , the Canada Pension Plan , and Canada Student Loans , though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.
[76] Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the 1982 patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
[77] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.
[80] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West .
[87] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a US-led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia .
[88] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 , but declined to join the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
[89] In 2009, Canada's economy suffered in the worldwide Great Recession , but it has since largely rebounded.
[93] Geography and climate [ edit ] Main articles: Geography of Canada and Climate of Canada Canada occupies much of the continent of North America, sharing land borders with the contiguous United States to the south, and the US state of Alaska to the northwest.
Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean.
By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.
By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth , the difference being due to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.
[95] Köppen climate types of Canada Since 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between 60° and 141°W longitude , [96] but this claim is not universally recognized.
[ according to whom? ] Canada is home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert , on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island – latitude 82.5°N – which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.
Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi); [98] additionally, its border with the United States is the world's longest land border, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi).
[99] Since the end of the last glacial period , Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield.
[100] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes (563 greater than 100 km 2 (39 sq mi)), more than any other country, containing much of the world's fresh water .
Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager , Mount Garibaldi , Mount Cayley , and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex .
[103] The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia.
[104] Canada's population density, at 3.3 inhabitants per square kilometre (8.5/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world.

As such, the Queen's representative, the Governor General of Canada (at present David Johnston ), carries out most of the federal royal duties in Canada.
[110] [113] [114] In practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by the Cabinet , a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada (at present Justin Trudeau ), [115] the head of government .
[118] [119] Constitutionally, an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election, although the Canada Elections Act currently limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October.
[120] Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 election: the Liberal Party of Canada who currently form the government, the Conservative Party of Canada who are the Official Opposition , the New Democratic Party , the Bloc Québécois , and the Green Party of Canada .
Canada's federal structure divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the ten provinces.
[114] Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.
[122] The Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country.
In addition, the Minister of Finance and Minister of Industry utilize the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development.
[123] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes .
[125] Law [ edit ] Main article: Law of Canada The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country, and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.
[127] Most notably, a series of eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between Aboriginals in Canada and the reigning Monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.

[143] Canada and the United States share the world's longest undefended border, co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partner.
[144] [145] Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba since, and declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
[146] Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie .
[147] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands , owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II .
Canada's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War , World War I and World War II.
Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.
[148] [149] During the Cold War , Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.
[152] Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989, [64] and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda , the former Yugoslavia , and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia Affair .

In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions : Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada , and Northern Canada ( Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).
Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act ; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice.

[170] [171] Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.
[172] However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector , in which the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components.
[173] Tree-map of Canada's goods exports in 2014.
[174] Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.
[175] Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources.
The vastness of the Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil reserves , comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia .
[176] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola , and other grains.
[177] Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc , uranium , gold , nickel , aluminum , steel , iron ore , coking coal and lead .
[178] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber.
Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.
[179] Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II .
[180] The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.

[182] The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.
[183] The global financial crisis of 2008 caused a major recession , which led to a significant rise in unemployment in Canada.
[184] By October 2009, Canada's national unemployment rate had reached 8.6 percent, with provincial unemployment rates varying from a low of 5.8 percent in Manitoba to a high of 17 percent in Newfoundland and Labrador.
[186] Canada's federal debt was estimated to total $566.7 billion for the fiscal year 2010–11, up from $463.7 billion in 2008–09.
[187] In addition, Canada's net foreign debt rose by $41 billion to $194 billion in the first quarter of 2010.
[188] However, Canada's regulated banking sector (comparatively conservative among G8 nations), the federal government's pre-crisis budgetary surpluses, and its long-term policies of lowering the national debt, resulted in a less severe recession compared to other G8 nations.
[190] [191] The federal government and many Canadian industries have also started to expand trade with emerging Asian markets, in an attempt to diversify exports; Asia is now Canada's second-largest export market after the United States.

[279] Multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments, [280] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity .
[283] However, as a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic —a collection of several regional, Aboriginal, and ethnic subcultures.
[284] Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration , social integration , and suppression of far right politics, has wide public support.
[285] Government policies such as publicly funded health care , higher taxation to redistribute wealth , the outlawing of capital punishment , strong efforts to eliminate poverty , strict gun control , and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.
[281] [287] Historically, Canada has been influenced by British , French , and Aboriginal cultures and traditions.
[291] Canada has a well-developed media sector , but its cultural output; particularly in English films , television shows , and magazines , is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.
[292] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).
[293] Symbols [ edit ] Main article: National symbols of Canada The mother beaver [294] on the Canadian parliament's Peace Tower .
Canada's national symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and Aboriginal sources.
The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags , and on the Arms of Canada .
[295] The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.
[296] The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent , proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers , lieutenant governors , senators, and judges.
[297] [298] Other prominent symbols include the beaver , Canada goose , common loon , the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, [295] and more recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk .
[299] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin , the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece , the beaver on the nickel .
[302] There are four major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality .
[304] Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life.
Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures such as Tom Thomson – the country's most famous painter – and by the Group of Seven .
[314] Music [ edit ] Main article: Music of Canada The Canadian music industry is the sixth largest in the world producing internationally renowned composers , musicians and ensembles .
[316] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards , which were first awarded in 1970.
[318] Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding the first legal steps to independence by over 50 years.
[319] The national anthem of Canada, " O Canada ", was originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec , the Honourable Théodore Robitaille , for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony, and was officially adopted in 1980.
[321] Sport [ edit ] Main articles: Sport in Canada and History of Canadian sports Canada's ice hockey victory at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver The roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s.
[322] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse .
[323] Seven of Canada's eight largest metropolitan areas – Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg – have franchises in the National Hockey League (NHL) while Quebec City had the Quebec Nordiques until they relocated to Colorado in 1995.
Canada does have one Major League Baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays , one professional basketball team, the Toronto Raptors , three Major League Soccer teams and four National Lacrosse League teams.
Canada has participated in almost every Olympic Games since its Olympic debut in 1900 , and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, including the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, the 1994 Basketball World Championship , the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup , the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup .
[324] Other popular professional sports in Canada include curling and Canadian football ; the latter is played professionally in the Canadian Football League (CFL).
