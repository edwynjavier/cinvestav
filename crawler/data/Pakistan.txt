Pakistan ( i / ˈ p æ k ᵻ s t æ n / or i / p ɑː k ᵻ ˈ s t ɑː n / ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia .
Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre-long (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively.
The territory that now constitutes Pakistan is considered a cradle of civilisation [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] which was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation , and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures, including Hindus , Indo-Greeks , Muslims , Turco-Mongols , Afghans and Sikhs .
Pakistan is unique among Muslim countries as it is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam.
[26] [27] As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the subcontinent 's struggle for independence, Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent nation for Muslims from the regions in the east and west of the Subcontinent where there was a Muslim majority.
Initially a dominion , Pakistan adopted a new constitution in 1956, becoming an Islamic republic.
An ethnic civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh .
In 1973 Pakistan adopted a new constitution which established a Federal Government based in Islamabad alongside its pre-existing parliamentary republic status – which consists of four provinces and four federal territories .
[28] A regional [29] [30] and middle power , [31] [32] Pakistan has the sixth largest standing armed forces in the world and is also a nuclear power as well as a declared nuclear-weapons state, being the second in South Asia and the only nation in the Muslim world , to have that status.
Pakistan has a semi-industrialised economy with a well-integrated agriculture sector , and a growing services sector [33] [34] The Pakistani economy is the 26th largest in the world in terms of purchasing power and the 41st largest in terms of nominal GDP .
[35] [36] [37] [38] The post-independence history of Pakistan has been characterised by periods of military rule and since 2008, a transition to democracy , amid conflicts with neighbouring India .

[44] It was coined in 1933 as Pakstan by Choudhry Rahmat Ali , a Pakistan Movement activist, who published it in his pamphlet Now or Never , [45] using it as an acronym ("thirty million Muslim brethren who live in PAKSTAN") referring to the names of the five northern regions of the British Raj : P unjab , A fghania , K ashmir , S indh , and Baluchis tan .
[49] History Main article: History of Pakistan See also: Outline of South Asian history You may need rendering support to display the Urdu text in this article correctly.
Early and medieval age Main articles: Indo-Greek Kingdom , Indus Valley Civilization , Vedic Civilization , Sikh Empire , and Mughal Empire Standing Buddha from Gandhara Some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day Pakistan.
[51] The Indus region , which covers most of present day Pakistan, was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic Mehrgarh [52] and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation (2800–1800 BC) at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro .
[64] The Pala Dynasty was the last Buddhist empire that under Dharampala and Devapala stretched across South Asia from what is now Bangladesh through Northern India to Pakistan.
The Arab conqueror Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Indus valley from Sindh to Multan in southern Punjab in 711 AD. [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] The Pakistan government's official chronology identifies this as the point where the "foundation" of Pakistan was laid.
[73] From the region of modern day Pakistan, key cities during the Mughal rule were Lahore and Thatta , [74] both of which were chosen to house immensely beautiful Mughal buildings .
[79] Colonial period Main articles: Pakistan Movement , Aligarh Movement , and British Raj Sir Syed Ahmad Khan (1817–98), whose vision formed the basis of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1876–1948) served as Pakistan's first Governor-General and the leader of the Pakistan Movement The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 18th century enabled the Sikh Empire 's influence to control larger areas until the British East-India Company gained ascendancy over the Indian subcontinent .
[80] In contrast to the Indian Congress 's anti-British efforts, the Muslim League was a pro-British whose political program inherited the British values that would shape Pakistan's future civil society .
[93] Muhammad Ali Jinnah , the founder of Pakistan , greatly espoused the two-nation theory and led the Muslim League to adopt the Lahore Resolution of 1940, popularly known as the Pakistan Resolution.
Thus the 1946 election was effectively a plebiscite where the Indian Muslims were to vote on the creation of Pakistan; a plebiscite which the Muslim League won.
[98] As the United Kingdom agreed upon partitioning of India in 1947, the modern state of Pakistan was established on 14 August 1947 (27th of Ramadan in 1366 of the Islamic Calendar ) in amalgamating the Muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of British India .
[91] It comprised the provinces of Balochistan , East Bengal , the North-West Frontier Province , West Punjab and Sindh ; thus forming Pakistan.
[107] [108] [109] [110] Around 6.5 million Muslims moved from India to West Pakistan and 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from West Pakistan to India.
[115] [116] Independence and modern Pakistan Main articles: Dominion of Pakistan and History of Pakistan Play media The American CIA film on Pakistan made in 1950 examines the history and geography of Pakistan.
"You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place or worship in this State of Pakistan.
— Muhammad Ali Jinnah 's first speech to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan [117] After independence and the partition of India in 1947, Muhammad Ali Jinnah , the President of the Muslim League , became the nation's first Governor-General as well as the first President-Speaker of the Parliament , [118] but he died of tuberculosis on 11 September 1948.
[119] Meanwhile, Pakistan's founding fathers agreed upon appointing Liaquat Ali Khan , the secretary-general of the party , the nation's first Prime Minister .
With dominion status in the Commonwealth of Nations , independent Pakistan had two British monarchs before it became a republic.
[118] The creation of Pakistan was never emotionally accepted by many British leaders, among them being Lord Mountbatten .
[120] Mountbatten clearly expressed his lack of support and faith in the Muslim League 's idea of Pakistan.
[121] Jinnah refused Mountbatten 's offer to serve as Governor-General of Pakistan.
[122] When Mountbatten was asked by Collins and Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan had he known that Jinnah was dying of tuberculosis, he replied 'most probably'.
[123] Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani , a respected Deobandi alim (scholar) who occupied the position of Shaykh al-Islam in Pakistan in 1949, and Maulana Mawdud i of Jamaat-i Islami played a pivotal role in the demand for an Islamic constitution.
Mawdudi demanded that the Constituent Assembly make an explicit declaration affirming the "supreme sovereignty of God" and the supremacy of the shariah in Pakistan.
The Objectives Resolution, which Liaquat Ali Khan called the second most important step in Pakistan's history, declared that "sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God Almighty alone and the authority which He has delegated to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust".
[126] [127] Consolidating the control from Ayub Khan in 1969, President Yahya Khan had to deal with a devastating cyclone which caused 500,000 deaths in East Pakistan .
In 1970, Pakistan held its first democratic elections since independence, that were meant to mark a transition from military rule to democracy, but after the East Pakistani Awami League won against Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP); Yahya Khan and military establishment refused to hand over power.
[129] [130] Operation Searchlight , a military crackdown on the Bengali nationalist movement, led to a declaration of independence and the waging of a war of liberation by the Bengali Mukti Bahini forces in East Pakistan, with support from India.
[130] [131] However, in West Pakistan the conflict was described as a civil war as opposed to War of Liberation.
[136] Preemptive strikes on India by the Pakistan's air force , navy , and marines , in response to India's support for the insurgency in East Pakistan, sparked the conventional war in 1971 which witnessed the Indian victory and East Pakistan gaining independence as Bangladesh .
[130] With Pakistan surrendering in the war, Yahya Khan was replaced by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as President ; the country worked towards promulgating constitution and putting the country on roads of democracy .
[137] During this period, Pakistan embarked on ambitiously developing the nuclear deterrence in 1972 in a view to prevent any foreign invasion ; the country's first nuclear power plant was inaugurated, also the same year.
From 1977 to 1988, President Zia 's corporatisation and economic Islamisation initiatives led to Pakistan becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in South Asia.
[140] While consolidating the nuclear development , increasing Islamization , [141] and the rise of homegrown conservative philosophy , Pakistan helped subsidise and distribute US resources to factions of the mujahideen against the USSR 's intervention in communist Afghanistan .
[142] [143] Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province became a base for the anti-Soviet Afghan fighters, with the province's influential Deobandi ulama playing a significant role in encouraging and organising the 'jihad'.
The Pakistan Peoples Party followed by conservative Pakistan Muslim League (N) , and over the next decade whose two leaders fought for power, alternating in office while the country's situation worsened; economic indicators fell sharply, in contrast to the 1980s.
[147] President Bush meets with President Musharraf in Islamabad during his 2006 visit to Pakistan.
[148] [149] Musharraf governed Pakistan as chief executive from 1999 to 2001 and as President from 2001 to 2008— a period of enlightenment , social liberalism , extensive economic reforms , [150] and direct involvement in the US-led war on terrorism .
[156] By its own financial calculations, Pakistan's involvement in the war on terrorism has cost up to ~$67.93 billion, [157] [158] thousands of casualties and nearly 3 million displaced civilians.
[160] Government and politics Main articles: Government of Pakistan , Politics of Pakistan , Political history of Pakistan , and Human rights in Pakistan Parliament House Pakistan's political experience is essentially related to the struggle of Indian Muslims to regain power which they lost to British colonisation.
[161] Pakistan is a democratic parliamentary federal republic with Islam as the state religion .
[163] The Pakistani military establishment has played an influential role in mainstream politics throughout Pakistan's political history .
[164] As of now, Pakistan has a multi-party parliamentary system with clear division of powers and responsibilities between branches of government .
Politics in Pakistan is centred and dominated by the homegrown conceive social philosophy , consisting the ideas of socialism , conservatism , and the third way .
As of the general elections held in 2013, the three main dominated political parties in the country: the centre-right conservative Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N); the centre-left socialist Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP); and the centrist and third-way Pakistan Movement for Justice (PTI) led by cricketer Imran Khan .
Head of State : The President who is elected by an Electoral College is the ceremonial head of the state and is the civilian commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces (with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee as its principal military adviser), but military appointments and key confirmations in the armed forces are made by the Prime Minister after reviewing the reports on their merit and performances.
However, the powers to pardon and grant clemency vest with the President of Pakistan .

U.S-Pak relations during the cold war As the Muslim world 's second most populous nation-state (after Indonesia ) and its only nuclear power state, Pakistan has an important role in the international community .
[167] [168] Its geostrategic intentions were explained by Jinnah in a broadcast message in 1947, which is featured in a prominent quotation on the homepage of Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website: "The foundation of our foreign policy is friendship with all nations across the globe."
[169] After Independence, Pakistan vigorously pursued bilateral relations with other Muslim countries [170] and made a wholehearted bid for leadership of the Muslim world , or at least for leadership in achieving its unity.
[171] The Ali brothers had sought to project Pakistan as the natural leader of the Islamic world, in large part due to its large manpower and military strength.
[172] A top ranking Muslim League leader, Khaliquzzaman , declared that Pakistan would bring together all Muslim countries into Islamistan -a pan-Islamic entity.
[173] Such developments (alongside Pakistan's creation) did not get American approval and British Prime Minister Clement Attlee voiced international opinion at the time by stating that he wished that India and Pakistan would re-unite.
[174] Since most of the Arab world was undergoing a nationalist awakening at the time, there was little attraction to Pakistan's Pan-Islamic aspirations.
[175] Some of the Arab countries saw the 'Islamistan' project as a Pakistani attempt to dominate other Muslim states.
[176] Pakistan vigorously championed the right of self-determination for Muslims around the world.
Pakistan's efforts for the independence movements of Indonesia , Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Eritrea were significant and initially led to close ties between these countries and Pakistan.
[177] However, Pakistan also masterminded an attack on the Afghan city of Jalalabad during the Afghan Civil War to establish an Islamic government there.
Pakistan had wished to forment an 'Islamic Revolution' which would transcend national borders covering Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia.
[178] On the other hand, Pakistan's relations with Iran have been strained at times due to sectarian tensions.
[179] Iran and Saudi Arabia used Pakistan as a battleground for their proxy sectarian war and by the 1990s, Pakistan's support for the Sunni Taliban organisation in Afghanistan became a problem for Shia Iran which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.
[180] Tensions between Iran and Pakistan intensified in 1988, when Iran accused Pakistan of war crimes as Pakistani warplanes had bombarded Afghanistan's last Shia stronghold in support of the Taliban.

Since Independence, Pakistan has attempted to balance its relations with foreign nations.
[183] [184] [185] A non- signatory party of the Treaty on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation , Pakistan is an influential member of the IAEA .
[186] In recent events, Pakistan has blocked an international treaty to limit fissile material , arguing that the "treaty would target Pakistan specifically."
[187] In the 20th century, Pakistan's nuclear deterrence program focused on countering India's nuclear ambitions in the region , and nuclear tests by India eventually led Pakistan to reciprocate the event to maintain geopolitical balance as becoming a nuclear power .
[188] Currently, Pakistan maintains a policy of credible minimum deterrence , calling its program vital nuclear deterrence against foreign aggression.
[189] [190] Located in strategic and geopolitical corridor of the world's major maritime oil supply lines , communication fibre optics , Pakistan has proximity to the natural resources of Central Asian countries.
[191] Pakistan is an influential and founding member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and is a major non-NATO ally of the United States in the war against terrorism — a status achieved in 2004.
[192] Pakistan's foreign policy and geostrategy mainly focus on economy and security against threats to its national identity and territorial integrity, and on the cultivation of close relations with other Muslim countries.
[193] Briefing on country's foreign policy in 2004, the Pakistani senator reportedly explains: "Pakistan highlights sovereign equality of states, bilateralism, mutuality of interests, and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs as the cardinal features of its foreign policy."
[194] Pakistan is an active member of the United Nations and has a Permanent Representative to represent Pakistan's policy in international politics.
[195] Pakistan has lobbied for the concept of " Enlightened Moderation " in the Muslim world .
[196] [197] Pakistan is also a member of Commonwealth of Nations , [198] the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) [199] [200] and the G20 developing nations .
[201] Pakistan does not have diplomatic relations with Israel ; [202] nonetheless some Israeli citizens have visited the country on a tourist visas.
[204] Despite Pakistan being the only country in the world that has not established a diplomatic relations with Armenia , the Armenian community still resides in Pakistan.
[205] Maintaining cultural, political, social, and economic relations with the Arab world and other countries in the Muslim World is a vital factor in Pakistan's foreign policy.
[206] Pakistan was the first country to have established diplomatic relations with China and relations continues to be warm since China's war with India in 1962.
[207] In the 1960s–1980s, Pakistan greatly helped China in reaching out to the world's major countries and helped facilitate US President Nixon 's state visit to China .
[207] Despite the change of governments in Pakistan, variations in the regional and global situation, China policy in Pakistan continues to be dominant factor at all time.
[207] In return, China is Pakistan's largest trading partner and economic co-operation have reached high points, with substantial Chinese investment in Pakistan's infrastructural expansion including the Pakistani deep-water port at Gwadar .
[208] [209] [210] [211] Both countries have signed the Free Trade Agreement in the 2000s, and Pakistan continues to serve as China 's communication bridge in the Muslim World .

[213] Because of difficulties in relations with its geopolitical rival India , Pakistan maintains close political relations with Turkey and Iran .
[214] Saudi Arabia also maintains a respected position in Pakistan's foreign policy, and both countries has been a focal point in Pakistan's foreign policy.
[215] Due to ideological differences, Pakistan opposed the Soviet Union in the 1950s and during Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, Pakistan was one of the closest allies of the United States.
[194] [216] Relations with Russia have greatly improved since 1999 and co-operation with various sectors have increased between Russia and Pakistan.
[217] Pakistan has had "on-and-off" relations with the United States.
A close ally of the United States in the Cold war , Pakistan's relation with the United States relations soured in the 1990s when the US imposed sanctions because of Pakistan's secretive nuclear development.
[218] Since 9/11 , Pakistan has been a close ally with the United States on the issue of counter-terrorism in the regions of the Middle East and South Asia , with the US supporting the latter with aid money and weapons.
[221] [222] [223] [224] Since 1948, there has been an ongoing, and at times fluctuating, violent conflict in the southwestern province of Balochistan between various Baloch separatist groups, who seek greater political autonomy, and the central government of Pakistan.
[225] In 2016 the official press agency of the People's Republic of China announced that the state will set up an anti-terrorism alliance with Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.

[147] The United States , Turkey , and China maintain close military relations and regularly export military equipment and technology transfer to Pakistan.
[254] Since 1947, Pakistan has been involved in four conventional wars , the first war occurred in Kashmir with Pakistan gaining control of Western Kashmir , ( Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan ), and India capturing Eastern Kashmir ( Jammu and Kashmir ).
Territorial problems eventually led to another conventional war in 1965; over the issue of Bengali refugees that led to another war in 1971 which resulted in Pakistan's unconditional surrender of East Pakistan .

[215] [285] Azad Kashmir is part of Pakistan controlled Kashmir.
[286] Pakistan claims Kashmir on the basis of a Muslim majority and of geography, the same principles that were applied for the creation of the two independent states.

However, Pakistan failed to vacate the region and a ceasefire was reached in 1949 with the Line of Control (LoC) was established, dividing Kashmir between the two nations .
This was confirmed in a statement by India's Defense Minister, Krishna Menon, who said: "Kashmir would vote to join Pakistan and no Indian Government responsible for agreeing to plebiscite would survive.''
[291] Pakistan claims that its position is for the right of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to determine their future through impartial elections as mandated by the United Nations , [292] while India has stated that Kashmir is an integral part of India, referring to the Simla Agreement (1972) and to the fact that elections take place regularly.

[295] The Muslim League leadership, ulama (Islamic clergy) and Jinnah had articulated their vision of Pakistan in terms of an Islamic state .
[297] Usmani asked Pakistanis to remember Jinnah's message of Unity, Faith and Discipline and work to fulfil his dream: [298] to create a solid bloc of all Muslim states from Karachi to Ankara, from Pakistan to Morocco.
The first formal step taken to transform Pakistan into an ideological Islamic state was in March 1949 when the country's first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan , introduced the Objectives Resolution in the Constituent Assembly.
[125] The president of the Muslim League, Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman , announced that Pakistan would bring together all Muslim countries into Islamistan-a pan-Islamic entity.
[300] Khaliq believed that Pakistan was only a Muslim state and was not yet an Islamic state, but that it could certainly become an Islamic state after bringing all believers of Islam into a single political unit.
[301] Keith Callard, one of the earliest scholars on Pakistani politics, observed that Pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world: [302] Pakistan was founded to advance the cause of Muslims.
However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments were not shared by other Muslim governments at the time.
[303] Although Muslim governments were unsympathetic with Pakistan's pan-Islamic aspirations, Islamists from all over the world were drawn to Pakistan.
[304] After General Zia-ul-Haq took power in a military coup, Hizb ut-Tahrir (an Islamist group calling for the establishment of a Caliphate) expanded its organisational network and activities in Pakistan.
Its founder, Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani , would maintain regular correspondence with Abul A’la Maududi , the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), and he also urged Dr Israr Ahmed to continue his work in Pakistan for the establishment of a global caliphate.
[305] Social scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed conducted a survey in 1969 in pre-divided Pakistan on the type of national identity that was used by educated professional people.
He found that over 60% of people in East Pakistan (modern day Bangladesh ) professed to have a secular national identity.
However, in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) the same figure professed to have an Islamic and not a secular identity.
Furthermore, the same figure in East Pakistan defined their identity in terms of their ethnicity and not Islam .
But it was the opposite in West Pakistan where Islam was stated to be more important than ethnicity.
[306] After Pakistan's first ever general elections the 1973 Constitution was created by an elected Parliament.
[307] The Constitution declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic and Islam as the state religion.
[316] New criminal offences (of adultery, fornication, and types of blasphemy), and new punishments (of whipping, amputation, and stoning to death), were added to Pakistani law.
[321] Zia's state sponsored Islamization increased sectarian divisions in Pakistan between Sunnis and Shias (due to Zia's anti-Shia policies) [322] and also between Deobandis and Barelvis .
[323] A solid majority of Barelvis had supported the creation of Pakistan, [324] and Barelvi ulama had also issued fatwas in support of the Pakistan Movement during the 1946 elections, [325] [326] but ironically Islamic state politics in Pakistan was mostly in favour of Deobandi (and later Ahl-e-Hadith/ Salafi ) institutions.
[327] This was despite the fact that only a few (although influential) Deobandi clerics had supported the Pakistan Movement .
[328] Possible motivations for the Islamization programme included Zia's personal piety (most accounts agree that he came from a religious family), [329] desire to gain political allies, to "fulfill Pakistan's raison d'être " as a Muslim state, and/or the political need to legitimise what was seen by some Pakistanis as his "repressive, un-representative martial law regime".
[331] A PEW opinion poll found that 84% of Pakistanis favoured making Sharia the official law of the land.
[332] According to the 2013 Pew Research Center report, the majority of Pakistani Muslims also support the death penalty for those who leave Islam (62%).
In contrast, support for the death penalty for those who leave Islam was only 36% in fellow South Asian Muslim country Bangladesh (which shared heritage with Pakistan).
[333] A 2010 opinion poll by PEW Research Centre also found that 87% of Pakistanis considered themselves 'Muslims first' rather than a member of their nationality.

[539] Since 1989, thousands of Kashmiri Muslim refugees have sought refuge in Pakistan, complaining that many of the refugee women had been raped by Indian soldiers and that they were forced out of their homes by the soldiers.
[541] There is also a large Pakistani diaspora worldwide, numbering over seven million, [542] which has been recorded as the sixth largest diaspora in the world.

Islam See also: Islam in Pakistan About 97.0% of Pakistanis are Muslims.
Pakistan has the second largest number of Muslims in the world after Indonesia.
[552] [553] [557] [558] Pakistan, like India, is said to have at least 16 million Shias.
[558] [559] [560] A PEW survey in 2012 found that only 6% of Pakistani Muslims were Shia.
[557] Pakistan's founder, Jinnah , had been born in a Shia family but other sources maintain that Jinnah became a firm Sunni Muslim later on in life.
[561] [562] [563] Shias allege discrimination by the Pakistani government since 1948, claiming that Sunnis are given preference in business, official positions and administration of justice.
[564] Attacks on Shias increased under the presidency of Zia-ul-Haq , [564] with the first major sectarian riots in Pakistan breaking out in 1983 in Karachi and later spreading to Lahore and Balochistan .
[565] In one notorious incident, the 1988 Gilgit Massacre , Osama bin Laden -led Sunni tribals assaulted, massacred and raped Shia civilians in Gilgit after being inducted by the Pakistan Army to quell a Shia uprising in Gilgit .
[573] The Ahmadis , are another minority sect in Pakistan, albeit in much smaller numbers (estimated between 0.22-2.2%)
[576] [577] As of 2012 [update] , 12% of Pakistani Muslims self-identify as non-denominational Muslims .
[580] Sufism , a mystical Islamic tradition, has a long history and a large popular following in Pakistan.
[582] There are two levels of Sufism in Pakistan.
Many rural Pakistani Muslims associate with pirs and seek their intercession.
[583] The second level of Sufism in Pakistan is 'intellectual Sufism' which is growing among the urban and educated population.They are influenced by the writings of Sufis such as the medieval theologian al-Ghazali , the Sufi reformer Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindi and Shah Wali Allah .
[585] [586] Hinduism See also: Hinduism in Pakistan Hinduism is the second largest religion in Pakistan after Islam, according to the 1998 Census.
[587] As of 2010 [update] , Pakistan had the fifth largest Hindu population in the world and PEW predicts that by 2050 Pakistan will have the fourth largest Hindu population in the world.
[587] Hindus are found in all provinces of Pakistan but are mostly concentrated in Sindh .
[530] At the time of Pakistan's creation the 'hostage theory' had been espoused.
According to this theory the Hindu minority in Pakistan was to be given a fair deal in Pakistan in order to ensure the protection of the Muslim minority in India.
[590] [591] However, Khawaja Nazimuddin, the second Prime Minister of Pakistan , stated: I do not agree that religion is a private affair of the individual nor do I agree that in an Islamic state every citizen has identical rights, no matter what his caste, creed or faith be.
[592] Some Hindus in Pakistan feel that they are treated as second-class citizens and many have continued to migrate to India.
[593] Pakistani Hindus faced riots after the Babri Masjid demolition, [594] have faced a massacre (in 2005) by security forces in Balochistan, [595] and have also faced several attacks, forced conversions and abductions.
[599] Culture and society Main articles: British heritage of Pakistan , Culture of Pakistan , and Public holidays in Pakistan Truck art in Pakistan is a unique feature of Pakistani culture.
Civil society in Pakistan is largely hierarchical, emphasising local cultural etiquettes and traditional Islamic values that govern personal and political life.
[602] Pakistani festivals such as Eid-ul-Fitr , Eid-ul-Azha , Ramazan , Christmas , Easter , Holi , and Diwali are mostly religious in origin.
[600] Increasing globalisation has resulted in Pakistan ranking 56th on the A.T. Kearney /FP Globalization Index .
[603] Clothing, arts, and fashion Main articles: Suits in Pakistan , Pakistani clothing , Sherwani , Jinnah cap , and Peshawari chappal The Shalwar Kameez is the national dress of Pakistan and is worn by both men and women in all four provinces : Punjab , Sindh , Balochistan , and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as in FATA and Azad Kashmir .
Pakistanis wear clothes range from exquisite colours and designs to the type of fabric ( silk , chiffon , cotton , etc).
Since Pakistan came into being, its fashion has historically evolved from different phases and made its unique identity apart from Indian fashion and culture.
At this time, Pakistani fashion is a combination of traditional and modern dresses and it has become the cultural identification of Pakistan.
The Pakistan Fashion Design Council based in Lahore organises Fashion Week and Fashion Pakistan based in Karachi organises fashion shows in that city.
Pakistan's first fashion week was held in November 2009.
[605] Role of women in Pakistani society Main articles: Women in Pakistan , Role of women in Pakistani media , Women in the Pakistan Armed Forces , and Protection of Women Against Violence Bill 2015 Benazir Bhutto was the first woman elected to lead a Muslim state, and is the only one to be elected twice Malala Yousafzai is the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate .
The social status of women in Pakistan varies and considerably depends on the social class , upbringings, and regional divide due to uneven socioeconomic development and the impact of social formations on women's lives in the country.
[606] Pakistan has had a long history of feminist activism since its birth.
[606] Personalities such as Begum Rana'a , Benazir Bhutto , Malala Yousafzai and Kalsoom Nawaz have been influential in Pakistan's feminist culture.
In 2014, the World Economic Forum ranked Pakistan as the second worst country in the world in gender equality .
[606] [608] Due to heightened awareness among people, educational opportunities for Pakistani women have increased over the years.
[609] On 24 February 2016, the elected assembly of Pakistan's Punjab province passed a new law called "Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence Bill 2015 " which provides women with protection against a multitude of crimes including: cyber crime, domestic violence, emotional, economic and psychological abuse.
[610] Media and entertainment Main articles: Cinema of Pakistan , Media of Pakistan , Music of Pakistan , History of Pakistani pop music , Theatre of Pakistan , and Pakistani dramas The private print media , state-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) and Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) for radio were the dominant media outlets until the 21st century.
Pakistan now has a large network of domestic private 24-hour news media and television channels .
[611] According to a 2016 report by the Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan in 147th on the Press Freedom Index , while terming the Pakistani media "among the freest in Asia when it comes to covering the squabbling among politicians."
[612] BBC term's Pakistani media as "among the most outspoken in South Asia." [613] The Lollywood , an Urdu, Punjabi and Pashto film industry is based in Karachi , Lahore , and Peshawar .
[619] Pakistani music ranges from diverse provincial folk music and traditional styles such as Qawwali and Ghazal Gayaki to modern forms fusing traditional and western music.
[620] [621] Pakistan has many famous folk singers.
[622] Pakistani media has also played a vital role in exposing corruption .
[623] Urbanisation Main article: Urbanisation in Pakistan Since achieving independence as a result of the partition of India , the urbanisation has exponentially increased and has several different causes for it.
During 1990–2008 , the city dwellers made up 36.0% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia .
Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.
[523] Immigration , both from within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors that has contributed to urbanisation in Pakistan.
One analysis of the national census held in 1998 highlighted the significance of the Partition of India in the 1940s in the context of understanding urban change in Pakistan.
[625] During the independence period, Muslim Muhajirs from India migrated in large numbers and shifted their domicile to Pakistan, especially to the port city of Karachi , which is today the largest metropolis in Pakistan.
[624] Migration from other countries , mainly those in the neighbourhood, has further catalysed the process of urbanisation in Pakistani cities.
Of particular interest is migration that occurred in the aftermath of the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, [624] in the form of stranded Biharis who were relocated to Pakistan.
The conflict in Afghanistan also forced millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, particularly in the northwestern regions.
[624] Diaspora Main articles: Cinema of Pakistan and Overseas Pakistani According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Pakistan has the sixth largest diaspora in the world.
[544] Statistics approximated by the Pakistani government show that there are around 7 million Pakistanis residing abroad with the vast majority living in the Middle East , Europe and North America .
[626] Pakistan ranks 10th in the world for remittances sent home in 2012 at $13 billion rising to $19.9 billion by 2015.
[629] The term Overseas Pakistani is officially recognised by the Government of Pakistan ; the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis was established in 2008 to exclusively deal with all the matters and affairs of the overseas Pakistanis such as attending to their needs and problems, intending schemes and projects for their welfare and working for resolution of their problems and issues.
Overseas Pakistani workers are the second largest source of Foreign Exchange Remittances to Pakistan after exports and over the last several years, the foreign exchange remittances have maintained a steady rising trend, with a recorded increase of 150% from US$6 billion in 2009 to estimated US$15 billion during 2015.
[394] [627] [628] [628] The Overseas Pakistani Division (OPD) was created in September 2004 within the Ministry of Labour (MoL), and has since recognised the importance of overseas Pakistanis and their contribution to the nation's economy .
Together with Community Welfare Attaches (CWAs) and the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF), the OPD is improving the welfare of Pakistanis who reside abroad.
The division aims to provide better services through improved facilities at airports , and suitable schemes for housing, education and health care —its largest effort is the facilitation of the rehabilitation of returning overseas Pakistanis.
Notable Pakistani diaspora's includes London Mayor Sadiq Khan , UK Cabinet Member Sajid Javid , former UK Conservative Party Chair Baroness Warsi , singer's Zayn Malik and Nadia Ali , MIT Physics Professor Dr. Nergis Mavalvala , actor's Riz Ahmed and Kumail Nanjiani , businessmen's Shahid Khan and Sir Anwar Pervez , Boston University professors Adil Najam and Hamid Nawab , Texas A&M Professor Muhammad Suhail Zubairy , Yale Professor Sara Suleri , UC San Diego Professor Farooq Azam and historian Ayesha Jalal Literature and philosophy Muhammad Iqbal , Pakistan's national poet who conceived the idea of Pakistan.

[633] Sufi poets Shah Abdul Latif , Bulleh Shah , Mian Muhammad Bakhsh and Khawaja Farid are very popular in Pakistan.
[640] Ideas from British and American philosophy greatly shaped philosophical development in Pakistan.
Analysts such as M.M. Sharif and Zafar Hassan established the first major Pakistani philosophical movement in 1947.
[641] After the 1971 war , philosophers such as Jalaludin Abdur Rahim , Gianchandani , and Malik Khalid incorporated Marxism into Pakistan's philosophical development .
[642] Influential work by Manzoor Ahmad , Jon Elia , Hasan Askari Rizvi , and Abdul Khaliq brought mainstream social , political , and analytical philosophy to the fore of Pakistani philosophical academia.
[643] [644] Architecture Main articles: Pakistani architecture and Hindu and Buddhist architectural heritage of Pakistan Minar-e-Pakistan is a public monument marking Pakistan's independence movement.
Pakistani architecture has four recognised periods: pre-Islamic , Islamic , colonial , and post-colonial .
The arrival of Islam in today's Pakistan meant a sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless Islamic architecture .
Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures like the Faisal Mosque , the Minar-e-Pakistan and the Mazar-e-Quaid .
[650] Food and drink Main article: Pakistani cuisine A Pakistani dish cooked using the tandoori method.
Pakistani cuisine is similar to cuisine from other regions of South Asia , since much of it originated from the royal kitchens of sixteenth-century Mughal emperors.
Pakistan has a greater variety of meat dishes compared to the rest of the sub-continent.
Unlike Middle Eastern cuisine, Pakistani cooking uses large quantities of spices, herbs and seasoning.
Black tea with milk and sugar is popular throughout Pakistan and is taken daily by most of the population.
[57] [653] Sohan Halwa is a popular sweet dish from the southern region of Punjab province and is enjoyed all over Pakistan.

The Destruction of Pakistan's Democracy .
Undivided India, their magnificent imperial trophy, was besmirched by the creation of Pakistan, and the division of India was never emotionally accepted by many British leaders, Mountbatten among them.
Jinnah, Pakistan and Islamic Identity: The Search for Saladin .
While doing so he clearly expressed his lack of support and faith in the Muslim League and its Pakistan idea.
Mountbatten tried to convince Jinnah of the value of accepting him, Mountbatten, as Pakistan's first governor-general, but Jinnah refused to be moved from his determination to take that job himself.
Jinnah, Pakistan and Islamic Identity: The Search for Saladin .
When Mountbatten was asked by Collins and Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan if he had known that Jinnah was dying of tuberculosis, his answer was instructive.
There was no doubt in his mind about the legality or morality of his position on Pakistan.
Pakistan .
Mawlānā Shabbīr Ahmad Usmānī, a respected Deobandī ʿālim (scholar) who was appointed to the prestigious position of Shaykh al-Islām of Pakistan in 1949, was the first to demand that Pakistan become an Islamic state.
Mawdūdī demanded that the Constituent Assembly make an unequivocal declaration affirming the “supreme sovereignty of God” and the supremacy of the sharīʿah as the basic law of Pakistan.
Pakistan .
The resolution embodied “the main principles on which the constitution of Pakistan is to be based.”
It declared that “sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God Almighty alone and the authority which He has delegated to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust,” that “the principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by Islam shall be fully observed,” and that “the Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and collective spheres in accord with the teaching and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Qurʿan and Sunna.”

Islam in Pakistan's foreign policy .
Pakistan's expression of solidarity was followed, after Independence, by a vigorous pursuit of bilateral relations with Muslim countries like Iran and Turkey.
Islam in Pakistan's foreign policy .
Pakistan was making a wholehearted bid for the leadership of the Muslim world, or at least for the leadership in achieving its unity.
Islam in Pakistan's foreign policy .
Following Khaliquzzaman, the Ali brothers had sought to project Pakistan, with its comparatively larger manpower and military strength, as the natural leader of the Islamic world.
As a top ranking ML leader Khaliquzzaman declared, 'Pakistan would bring all Muslim countries together into Islamistan- a pan-Islamic entity'.
Magnificent Delusions: Pakistan, the United States, and an Epic History of Misunderstanding .
Within a few years the president of the Muslim League, Chaudhry Khaliq-uz-Zaman, announced that Pakistan would bring all Muslim countries together into Islamistan-a pan-Islamic entity.
He hoped that the proposed dominions of India and Pakistan would in course of time, come together to form one great Member State of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
Magnificent Delusions: Pakistan, the United States, and an Epic History of Misunderstanding .
Pan-Islamic dreams involving the unification of Muslim countries, possibly under Pakistani leadership, had little attraction.
The Arab states, often citing Pakistan's inability to solve its problems with Muslim neighbor Afghanistan, showed little enthusiasm...Some saw the effort to form 'Islamistan' as a Pakistani attempt to dominate other Muslim states.
Explaining Pakistan’s Foreign Policy: Escaping India .
The belief that the creation of Pakistan made Pakistan the true leader of Muslim causes around the world led Pakistan's diplomats to vigorously champion the cause of self-determination for fellow Muslims at the United Nations.
Pakistan's founders, including Jinnah, supported anti-colonial movements: Our heart and soul go out in sympathy with those who are struggling for their freedom...If subjugation and exploitation are carried on, there will be no peace and there will be no end to wars.
Pakistani efforts on behalf of Indonesia (1948), Algeria (1948-1949), Tunisia (1948-1949), Morocco (1948-1956) and Eritrea (1960-1991) were significant and initially led to close ties between these countries and Pakistan.
"The legacy of Pakistan's loved and loathed Hamid Gul" .
His commitment to jihad - to an Islamic revolution transcending national boundaries, was such that he dreamed one day the "green Islamic flag" would flutter not just over Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also over territories represented by the (former Soviet Union) Central Asian republics.
After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, as the director-general of the Pakistan's intelligence organisation, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, an impatient Gul wanted to establish a government of the so-called Mujahideen on Afghan soil.
He then ordered an assault using non-state actors on Jalalabad, the first major urban centre across the Khyber Pass from Pakistan, with the aim capturing it and declaring it as the seat of the new administration.
Since then, Pakistan's sectarian tensions have been a major irritant in Iranian-Pakistan relations.
Explaining Pakistan’s Foreign Policy: Escaping India .
Both Saudi Arabia and Iran used Pakistan as a battleground for their proxy war for the 'hearts and minds' of Pakistani Sunnis and Shias with the resultant rise in sectarian tensions in Pakistan.
The rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan in the 1990s further strained Pakistan-Iran relations.
Pakistan's support of the Sunni Pashtun organization created problems for Shia Iran for whom a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan was a nightmare.
"Iran Raises Anti-pakistan Outcry" .
KARACHI, Pakistan — Iran, which has amassed 200,000 troops on the border with Afghanistan, accused Pakistan on Sunday of sending warplanes to strafe and bombard Afghanistan's last Shiite stronghold, which fell hours earlier to the Taliban, the Sunni militia now controlling the central Asian country.
Taliban officials accused Iran of providing military support to the opposition forces; Tehran radio accused Pakistan of sending its air force to bomb the city in support of the Taliban's advance and said Iran was holding Pakistan responsible for what it termed war crimes at Bamiyan.
Pakistan has denied that accusation and previous allegations of direct involvement in the Afghan conflict.
Iran, a Shiite Muslim state, has a strong interest in promoting that sect; Pakistan, one of the Taliban's few international allies, is about 80 percent Sunni.

But it falls short of the main demand of the people of Gilgit- Baltistan for a constitutional status to the region as a fifth province and for Pakistani citizenship to its people.

Nearly 70 years ago, the people of the Gilgit Wazarat revolted and joined Pakistan of their own free will, as did those belonging to the territories of Chilas, Koh Ghizr, Ishkoman, Yasin and Punial; the princely states of Hunza and Nagar also acceded to Pakistan.
Hence, the time has come to acknowledge and respect their choice of being full-fledged citizens of Pakistan.

Pakistan definitely defied the United Nations ban on supply of arms to the Bosnian Muslims and sophisticated anti-tank guided missiles were airlifted by the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, to help Bosnians fight the Serbs.
Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, the Army, and America's War on Terror .
Pakistan's notorious Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, the supporters of the Afghan Mujahidin in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s, violated the UN embargo and provided Bosnian Muslims with sophisticated antitank guided missiles.
NEW DELHI: In a startling revelation, a former ISI chief has claimed in his petition that Pakistan defied the United Nations ban on supply of arms to Bosnia and sophisticated anti-tank guided missiles were air lifted to them by the ISI.
The petition, downloaded from the website of US-based Pakistani web weekly South Asia Tribune, referred to his career, recounting his achievements and his credentials as a leading Islamic international figure and alleged that he had been defamed by a report in the English language newspaper The News.
The documents go on to give details of how the US threatened Pakistan, then ruled by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, to be declared as a terrorist state, if Sharif did not remove him from the post of the ISI chief.

In December 1971, Pakistan lost half its country, and with over ~90,000 troops of its military becoming POWs , all its earlier myth could not survive this no longer...   ^ Sean Anderson (2009).
Former Indian Defense Minister Krishna Menon who for years influenced the decisions of late Prime Minister Nehru himself a Kashmiri-put it bluntly last March in an interview with an American newsman when he said India could never agree to a U.N. sponsored plebiscite because 'Kashmir would vote to join Pakistan, and no Indian government responsible for agreeing to the plebiscite could survive.'

Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India .
The idea of Pakistan may have had its share of ambiguities, but its dismissal as a vague emotive symbol hardly illuminates the reasons as to why it received such overwhelmingly popular support among Indian Muslims, especially those in the 'minority provinces' of British India such as U.P.   ^ Dhulipala, Venkat (2015).
Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India .
As the book has demonstrated, local ML functionaries, (U.P.) ML leadership, Muslim modernists at Aligarh, the ulama and even Jinnah at times articulated their vision of Pakistan in terms of an Islamic state.
Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India .
But what is undeniable is the close association he developed with the ulama, for when he died a little over a year after Pakistan was born, Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, in his funeral oration, described Jinnah as the greatest Muslim after the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.
Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India .
Similarly, Usmani asked Pakistanis to remember the Qaid's ceaseless message of Unity, Faith and Discipline and work to fulfil his dream to create a solid bloc of all Muslim states from Karachi to Ankara, from Pakistan to Morocco.
Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military .
The first formal step toward transforming Pakistan into an Islamic ideological state was taken in March 1949 when the country's first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, presented the Objectives Resolution in the constituent assembly.
Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military .
The president of the Muslim League, Chaudhry Khaliq-uz-zaman announced that Pakistan would bring all Muslim countries together into Islamistan-a pan-Islamic entity.
Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India .
He claimed that as of now Pakistan was only a Muslim state in view of the majority of its population being Muslim, and indeed could never be an Islamic state by itself.
Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military .
One of the earliest Western scholars of Pakistani politics, Keith Callard, observed that Pakistanis seemed to believe in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world: Pakistan was founded to advance the cause of Muslims.
Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military .
Pakistan's pan-Islamic aspirations, however, were neither shared nor supported by the Muslim governments of the time.
Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military .
Although Muslim governments were initially unsympathetic to Pakistan's pan-Islamic aspirations, Islamists from the world over were drawn to Pakistan.
Nabhani also urged Dr Israr Ahmed – who split from Maududi opposing participation in elections and set up his Tanzeem-e-Islami, a pan-Islamist organisation that also advocates an international caliphate – to continue his work in Pakistan for the establishment of a global caliphate, wrote Zahid.
It was after General Ziaul Haq had taken over power in a military coup in 1977 that HuT expanded its organisational network and activities in Pakistan.
The social scientist, Nasim Ahmad Jawed has conducted a survey of nationalism in pre-divided Pakistan and identifies the links between religion, politics and nationalism in both wings of Pakistan.
His findings are fascinating and go some way to explain the differing attitudes of West and East Pakistan to the relationship between Islam and Pakistani nationalism and how this affected the views of people in both wings, especially the views of the peoples of both wings towards each other.
The Shariat judicial courts were not present in the original Constitution of 1973 and were later inserted in 1979 by General Zia-ul Haq...   ^ a b Double Jeopardy: Police Abuse of Women in Pakistan .

In the 1940s a solid majority of the Barelvis were supporters of the Pakistan Movement and played a supporting role in its final phase (1940-7), mostly under the banner of the All-India Sunni Conference which had been founded in 1925.
For example, the Barelvi ulama supported the formation of the state of Pakistan and thought that any alliance with Hindus (such as that between the Indian National Congress and the Jamiat ulama-I-Hind [JUH]) was counterproductive.
Pakistan: The Struggle Within .
Faith-Based Violence and Deobandi Militancy in Pakistan .
Ironically, Islamic state politics in Pakistan was mostly in favour of Deobandi, and more recently Ahl-e Hadith/Salafi, institutions.
Only a few Deobandi clerics decided to support the Pakistan Movement, but they were highly influential.

Uso en Pakistán [ editar ] El urdú en Pakistán ha sufrido cambios y últimamente ha incorporado y tomado muchas palabras de lenguas como pashto pakistaní, panyabí , sindh y balti , permitiendo así que los hablantes del idioma en Pakistán se distinguen con mayor facilidad y dar a la lengua un sabor decididamente pakistaní.
Esta variación del urdú se refiere a veces como urdú pakistaní.
Hay millones de pakistaníes cuya lengua materna no es el urdú, pero ya que han estudiado en escuelas de enseñanza media urdú, que pueden leer y escribir en urdú, junto con su lengua materna.
Con un número tan grande de personas de habla urdú, el idioma en los últimos años ha adquirido un sabor peculiar pakistaní que la distingue del urdú hablado por hablantes nativos y ha diversificado aún más la lengua.

Agency Copyright Notice Previous Next The World Factbook × South Asia :: PAKISTAN Introduction :: PAKISTAN Background: The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the world and dating back at least 5,000 years, spread over much of what is presently Pakistan.
The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved, and India and Pakistan fought two wars and a limited conflict - in 1947-48, 1965, and 1999 respectively - over the disputed Kashmir territory.
A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India capitalized on Islamabad's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh.
In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan conducted its own tests in mid-1998.
India-Pakistan relations improved in the mid-2000s but have been rocky since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks and have been further strained by attacks in India by militants suspected of being backed by Pakistan.
Nawaz SHARIF took office as prime minister in 2013, marking the first time in Pakistani history that a democratically elected government completed a full term and transitioned to a successive democratically elected government.
Following a series of bomb and suicide attacks by the Tehrik-e Pakistan Taliban (TTP) begun in 2007, the Pakistan Government and TTP representatives agreed to a cease-fire in early 2014.
However, by mid-year 2014 the talks collapsed and the TTP resumed attack plotting against Pakistani targets.

Pakistan has a large English-speaking population.
Textiles and apparel account for most of Pakistan's export earnings, and Pakistan's failure to diversify its exports has left the country vulnerable to shifts in world demand.
Pakistan’s GDP growth has gradually increased since 2012.
In coordination with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pakistan embarked on an economic reform program in 2013.
While the reform process has been mixed, and issues like privatization of state-owned enterprises remain unresolved, Pakistan has restored macroeconomic stability, improved its credit rating, and boosted growth.
The Pakistani rupee, after heavy depreciation, remained relatively stable against the US dollar in 2014-15.
Remittances from overseas workers, averaging more than $1.5 billion a month, are a key revenue source for Pakistan, partly compensating for a lack of foreign investment and a slowdown in portfolio investment.
Pakistan’s program with the IMF – a three-year, $6.7 billion Extended Fund Facility focusing on reducing energy shortages, stabilizing public finances, expanding revenue, and improving the external balance – is slated to conclude in September 2016.
While passing most quantitative targets, Pakistan has missed targets on structural reforms and performance criteria throughout the program.
Pakistan remains stuck in a low-income, low-growth trap, with growth averaging about 3.5% per year from 2008 to 2013.
Pakistan must address long-standing issues related to government revenues, with the tax base being narrow at 11% of GDP.
Given demographic challenges, Pakistan’s leadership will be pressed to implement economic reforms, promote further development of the energy sector, and attract foreign investment to support sufficient economic growth necessary to employ its growing and rapidly urbanizing population, much of which is under the age of 25.
Pakistan and China are implementing the “China-Pakistan Economic Corridor”, a $46 billion investment program targeted towards the energy sector and other infrastructure project that Islamabad and Beijing had agreed on in early 2014.

Kashmir nevertheless remains the site of the world's largest and most militarized territorial dispute with portions under the de facto administration of China (Aksai Chin), India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Northern Areas); UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan has maintained a small group of peacekeepers since 1949; India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding historic Kashmir lands to China in 1964; India and Pakistan have maintained their 2004 cease-fire in Kashmir and initiated discussions on defusing the armed standoff in the Siachen glacier region; Pakistan protests India's fencing the highly militarized Line of Control and construction of the Baglihar Dam on the Chenab River in Jammu and Kashmir, which is part of the larger dispute on water sharing of the Indus River and its tributaries; to defuse tensions and prepare for discussions on a maritime boundary, India and Pakistan seek technical resolution of the disputed boundary in Sir Creek estuary at the mouth of the Rann of Kutch in the Arabian Sea; Pakistani maps continue to show the Junagadh claim in India's Gujarat State; since 2002, with UN assistance, Pakistan has repatriated 3.8 million Afghan refugees, leaving about 2.6 million; Pakistan has sent troops across and built fences along some remote tribal areas of its treaty-defined Durand Line border with Afghanistan, which serve as bases for foreign terrorists and other illegal activities; Afghan, Coalition, and Pakistan military meet periodically to clarify the alignment of the boundary on the ground and on maps Refugees and internally displaced persons: refugees (country of origin): 2.6 million (1.6 million registered, 1.0 million undocumented) (Afghanistan) (2015) IDPs: 1.459 million (primarily those who remain displaced by counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations and violent conflict between armed non-state groups in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber-Paktunkwa Province; more than 1 million displaced in Northern Waziristan in 2014; individuals also have been displaced by repeated monsoon floods) (2015) Trafficking in persons: current situation: Pakistan is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; the largest human trafficking problem is bonded labor in agriculture, brickmaking and, to a lesser extent, fishing, mining and carpet-making; children are bought, sold, rented, and placed in forced begging rings, domestic service, small shops, brick kilns, or prostitution; militant groups also force children to spy, fight, or die as suicide bombers, kidnapping the children or getting them from poor parents through sale or coercion; women and girls are forced into prostitution or marriages; Pakistani adults migrate to the Gulf States and African and European states for low-skilled jobs and sometimes become victims of forced labor, debt bondage, or prostitution; foreign adults and children, particularly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, may be subject to forced labor, and foreign women may be sex trafficked in Pakistan, with refugees and ethnic minorities being most vulnerable tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List – Pakistan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the government lacks political will and capacity to fully address human trafficking, as evidenced by ineffective law enforcement efforts, official complicity, penalization of victims, and the continued conflation of migrant smuggling and human trafficking by many officials; not all forms of trafficking are prohibited; an anti-trafficking bill drafted in 2013 to address gaps in existing legislation remains pending, and a national action plan drafted in 2014 is not finalized; feudal landlords and brick kiln owners use their political influence to protect their involvement in bonded labor, while some police personnel have taken bribes to ignore prostitution that may have included sex trafficking; authorities began to use standard procedures for the identification and referral of trafficking victims, but it is not clear how widely these methods were practiced; in other instances, police were reluctant to assist NGOs with rescues and even punished victims for crimes committed as a direct result of being trafficked (2015) Illicit drugs: significant transit area for Afghan drugs, including heroin, opium, morphine, and hashish, bound for Iran, Western markets, the Gulf States, Africa, and Asia; financial crimes related to drug trafficking, terrorism, corruption, and smuggling remain problems; opium poppy cultivation estimated to be 2,300 hectares in 2007 with 600 of those hectares eradicated;
