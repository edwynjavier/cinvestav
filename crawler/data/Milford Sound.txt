Glorious on a fine day, Milford Sound’s ethereal, moody beauty in the rain is equally spectacular.

&plus; More – Less History Milford Sound is believed to have been discovered by the Maori over 1,000 years ago.
Milford Sound was well known to Maori but not discovered by Europeans until 1812 when Captain John Grono named it Milford Haven after his homeland in Wales.
Its name was later changed to Milford Sound by Captain John Lort Stokes.
The popular origin of why Milford Sound was called Piopiotahi by local Maori was that it came from a native bird, the piopio, now thought extinct.

Coordenadas : 44°40′30″S 167°55′46″E ﻿ / ﻿ -44.675, 167.92944444444 [ editar datos en Wikidata ] Milford Sound , también conocido como Piopiotahi en maorí , es un fiordo situado en el suroeste de la Isla Sur de Nueva Zelanda .
Milford Sound es el sitio más famoso de Nueva Zelanda para los turistas, [ cita requerida ] además de ser llamado la «octava maravilla del mundo» por Rudyard Kipling , y está situada dentro del Parque nacional de Fiordland , que está dentro del Te Wahipounamu , declarado Patrimonio de la Humanidad .
Índice 1 Geografía 1.1 Clima 2 Turismo 2.1 Descripción 2.2 Transporte 3 Otros aspectos 4 Galería 5 Referencias 6 Enlaces externos Geografía [ editar ] Milford Sound se extiende 15 kilómetros tierra adentro desde el mar de Tasmania y está rodeado de rocas escarpadas que alcanzan más de 1200 de altura en cada lado.
Clima [ editar ] Con una media de precipitaciones anual de 6813 mm a lo largo de 182 días, un nivel alto hasta para la costa oeste, Milford Sound es conocido como el lugar más húmedo de Nueva Zelanda y uno de los más húmedos del mundo.
Parámetros climáticos promedio de Milford Sound  Mes Ene.
[ cita requerida ] Esto hace del Milford Sound uno de los sitios turísticos de Nueva Zelanda más visitados, [ cita requerida ] y se podría decir que el más famoso destino turístico, pese a su alejada locación y el largo viaje desde los más cercanos pueblos.
[ cita requerida ] La mayoría de los turistas que van a Milford Sound prefieren ir en los barcos turísticos que normalmente realizan trayectos que duran entre 1 y 2 horas.
[ cita requerida ] Son ofrecidos por varias compañías, y parten desde el Centro de Visitantes de Milford Sound, también existe la opción de cruceros nocturnos.
El senderismo y el canotaje son habituales en Milford Sound.
Transporte [ editar ] Por carretera, Milford Sound está a 295 km de Queenstown y a 279 km de Invercargill (unas 4 horas de viaje), la mayoría de los autobuses turísticos parten de Queenstown o Te Anau, un pequeño centro turístico a 121 km al sur.
El camino hacia Milford Sound atraviesa varios paisajes montañosos antes de llegar a los 1,2 km del Homer Tunnel , el cual emerge desde los bosques húmedos hasta llegar al valle.
La larga distancia hacia Milford Sound desde Queenstone, hace que los operadores turísticos salgan desde muy temprano por la mañana y vuelvan muy tarde por la noche, dejando que los turistas tengan algunas horas al mediodía para visitar Milford Sound, como consecuencia, hay una gran congestión de tráfico en las horas punta del día, en la temporada turística.
Una alternativa pera evitar un día tan largo y disfrutar la carretera Milford más detenidamente es hospedarse en el pueblo de Te Anau la noche antes de ir a Milford Sound por carretera y salir temprano de Te Anau.
A través de los años, se han discutido muchas formas de acortar la distancia entre Queenstone y Milford Sound, entre ellas la góndola , un túnel más rápido o un monorail, todos estos tendrían que pasar por Te Anau, lo que aportaría mucho al turismo de este pequeño pueblo.
Milford Sound se puede alcanzar a pie través de la famosa travesía Milford track , algo parecido al camino de Santiago en España .
Otros aspectos [ editar ] El 8 de febrero de 2004 se derramaron 13 000 litros de diésel , teniendo como consecuencia una mancha de más de 2 km de largo, lo que hizo cerrar el Milford Sound por 2 días mientras varias actividades de limpieza se llevaron a cabo.
Cerca de Milford Sound se rodaron algunas escenas de Argonath en El Señor de los Anillos: La Comunidad del Anillo Galería [ editar ] Detalle de una catarata.

About Milford Sound Milford Sound is the most well-known and most accessible of all the fiords in New Zealand’s Fiordland National Park, a World Heritage Area.
Milford Sound is in the heart of a rainforest (annual rainfall is 6,813mm or 268 inches) which creates walls of temporary waterfalls on a wet day receding to just two permanent waterfalls (Lady Bowen Falls and Stirling Falls) in drier conditions.
Glorious on a fine day, Milford Sound’s ethereal, moody beauty in the rain is equally spectacular.
Getting There The journey to Milford Sound is just as spectacular as the destination itself, whether you travel by road or by air.
Milford Sound is around 5-6 hours (one-way) from Queenstown and around 3 hours from Te Anau by road.

&plus; More – Less History Milford Sound is believed to have been discovered by the Maori over 1,000 years ago.
Milford Sound was well known to Maori but not discovered by Europeans until 1812 when Captain John Grono named it Milford Haven after his homeland in Wales.
Its name was later changed to Milford Sound by Captain John Lort Stokes.
The popular origin of why Milford Sound was called Piopiotahi by local Maori was that it came from a native bird, the piopio, now thought extinct.
