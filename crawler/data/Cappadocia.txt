According to Herodotus , [1] in the time of the Ionian Revolt (499 BC) the Cappadocians were reported as occupying a region from Mount Taurus to the vicinity of the Euxine ( Black Sea ).
Cappadocia, in this sense, was bounded in the south by the chain of the Taurus Mountains that separate it from Cilicia , to the east by the upper Euphrates , to the north by Pontus , and to the west by Lycaonia and eastern Galatia .
Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography and climate 3 History 3.1 Kingdom of Cappadocia 3.2 Roman and Byzantine province 3.3 Early Christianity 3.4 Turkish Cappadocia 4 Modern tourism 5 Mesothelioma 6 Media 7 Sports 8 Gallery 9 See also 10 References 11 Sources Etymology [ edit ] View of Cappadocia lanscape The earliest record of the name of Cappadocia dates from the late 6th century BC , when it appears in the trilingual inscriptions of two early Achaemenid kings, Darius I and Xerxes , as one of the countries ( Old Persian dahyu- ) of the Persian Empire .
[5] Therefore the recent modification of this proposal operates with the Hittite katta peda- , literally "place below" as a starting point for the development of the toponym Cappadocia.
[6] Herodotus tells us that the name of the Cappadocians was applied to them by the Persians , while they were termed by the Greeks "Syrians" or "White Syrians" Leucosyri .
One of the Cappadocian tribes he mentions is the Moschoi, associated by Flavius Josephus with the biblical figure Meshech , son of Japheth : "and the Mosocheni were founded by Mosoch; now they are Cappadocians".
Cappadocia appears in the biblical account given in the book of Acts 2:9 .
The Cappadocians were named as one group hearing the Gospel account from Galileans in their own language on the day of Pentecost shortly after the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
Acts 2:5 seems to suggest that the Cappadocians in this account were "God-fearing Jews ".
Under the later kings of the Persian Empire, the Cappadocians were divided into two satrapies , or governments, with one comprising the central and inland portion, to which the name of Cappadocia continued to be applied by Greek geographers , while the other was called Pontus .
As after the fall of the Persian government the two provinces continued to be separate, the distinction was perpetuated, and the name Cappadocia came to be restricted to the inland province (sometimes called Great Cappadocia), which alone will be the focus of this article.
The kingdom of Cappadocia still existed in the time of Strabo (ca 64 BC - ca 24 AD) as a nominally independent state.
The only two cities of Cappadocia considered by Strabo to deserve that appellation were Caesarea (originally known as Mazaca ) and Tyana , not far from the foot of the Taurus .
Geography and climate [ edit ] Fairy chimneys in Uçhisar, Cappadocia.
Cappadocia lies in central Anatolia , in the heartland of what is now Turkey .
The boundaries of historical Cappadocia are vague, particularly towards the west.
To the south, the Taurus Mountains form the boundary with Cilicia and separate Cappadocia from the Mediterranean Sea .
To the west, Cappadocia is bounded by the historical regions of Lycaonia to the southwest, and Galatia to the northwest.
The Black Sea coastal ranges separate Cappadocia from Pontus and the Black Sea , while to the east Cappadocia is bounded by the upper Euphrates, before that river bends to the southeast to flow into Mesopotamia , and the Armenian Highland .
Due to its inland location and high altitude, Cappadocia has a markedly continental climate, with hot dry summers and cold snowy winters.
Fairy Chimneys rock formation near Göreme, in Cappadocia History [ edit ] See also: Cappadocia (satrapy) and List of rulers of Cappadocia 16th-century map of Anatolia from Münster's Cosmographia showing "Capadocia" Cappadocia was known as Hatti in the late Bronze Age , and was the homeland of the Hittite power centred at Hattusa .
After the fall of the Hittite Empire, with the decline of the Syro-Cappadocians ( Mushki ) after their defeat by the Lydian king Croesus in the 6th century, Cappadocia was ruled by a sort of feudal aristocracy, dwelling in strong castles and keeping the peasants in a servile condition, which later made them apt to foreign slavery.
Kingdom of Cappadocia [ edit ] After ending the Persian Empire, Alexander the Great tried to rule the area through one of his military commanders.
But Ariarathes , a Persian aristocrat, somehow became king of the Cappadocians.
As Ariarathes I (332–322 BC), he was a successful ruler, and he extended the borders of the Cappadocian Kingdom as far as to the Black Sea .
The kingdom of Cappadocia lived in peace until the death of Alexander.
The previous empire was then divided into many parts, and Cappadocia fell to Eumenes .
Persian colonists in the Cappadocian kingdom, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper, continued to practice Zoroastrianism .
[8] Under Ariarathes IV , Cappadocia came into relations with Rome , first as a foe espousing the cause of Antiochus the Great , then as an ally against Perseus of Macedon .
[9] Roman and Byzantine province [ edit ] Main article: Cappadocia (Roman province) The Cappadocians, supported by Rome against Mithridates VI of Pontus , elected a native lord, Ariobarzanes , to succeed (93 BC); but in the same year Armenian troops under Tigranes the Great entered Cappadocia, dethroned king Ariobarzanes and crowned Gordios as the new client-king of Cappadocia, thus creating a buffer zone against the encroaching Romans.
In the civil wars Cappadocia was first for Pompey , then for Caesar , then for Antony , and finally, Octavian .
The Ariobarzanes dynasty came to an end, a Cappadocian nobleman Archelaus was given the throne, by favour first of Antony and then of Octavian, and maintained tributary independence until AD 17, when the emperor Tiberius , who he had angered, summoned him to Rome and reduced Cappadocia to a Roman province.
Cappadocia contains several underground cities (see Kaymaklı Underground City ), largely used by early Christians as hiding places before Christianity became an accepted religion [ citation needed ] .
Early Christianity [ edit ] The Cappadocian Fathers of the 4th century were integral to much of early Christian philosophy .
It also produced, among other people, another Patriarch of Constantinople , John of Cappadocia , who held office 517–520.
From the 7th century, Cappadocia was divided between the Anatolic and Armeniac themes .
In the 9th–11th centuries, the region comprised the themes of Charsianon and Cappadocia .
Cappadocia shared an always-changing relationship with neighbouring Armenia , by that time a region of the Empire.
The Arab historian Abu Al Faraj asserts the following about Armenian settlers in Sivas , during the 10th century: "Sivas, in Cappadocia, was dominated by the Armenians and their numbers became so many that they became vital members of the imperial armies.
[10] As a result of the Byzantine military campaigns and the Seljuk invasion of Armenia, the Armenians spread into Cappadocia and eastward from Cilicia into the mountainous areas of northern Syria and Mesopotamia , and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia was eventually formed.
To the crusaders, Cappadocia was "terra Hermeniorum," the land of the Armenians, due to the large number of Armenians settled there.
[11] Turkish Cappadocia [ edit ] Cappadocia is famous for traditional cave hotels.
With the rise of Turkish power in Anatolia, Cappadocia slowly became a tributary to the Turkish states that were established to the east and to the west; some of the population converted to Islam with the remainder forming the Cappadocian Greek population.
Cappadocia remained part of the Ottoman Empire for the centuries to come, and remains now part of the modern state of Turkey .
[12] In the meantime many former Cappadocians had shifted to a Turkish dialect (written in Greek alphabet , Karamanlıca ), and where the Greek language was maintained (Sille, villages near Kayseri, Pharasa town and other nearby villages), it became heavily influenced by the surrounding Turkish.
This dialect of Greek is known as Cappadocian Greek .
Modern tourism [ edit ] Hot-air ballooning is very popular in Cappadocia.
Touristic Cappadocia includes 4 cities: Nevsehir, Kayseri, Aksaray and Nigde.
The most important towns and destinations in Cappadocia are Ürgüp , Goreme, Ihlara Valley, Selime, Guzelyurt, Uchisar, Avanos and Zelve.
Hot-air ballooning is very popular in Cappadocia and is available in Goreme.
Sedimentary rocks formed in lakes and streams and ignimbrite deposits that erupted from ancient volcanoes approximately 9 to 3 million years ago, during the late Miocene to Pliocene epochs, underlie the Cappadocia region.
The rocks of Cappadocia near Göreme eroded into hundreds of spectacular pillars and minaret -like forms.
People of the villages at the heart of the Cappadocia Region carved out houses, churches and monasteries from the soft rocks of volcanic deposits.
The Göreme Open Air Museum is the most visited site of the monastic communities in Cappadocia (see Churches of Göreme, Turkey ) and is one of the most famous sites in central Turkey.
Mesothelioma [ edit ] In 1975 a study of three small villages in central Cappadocia—Tuzköy, Karain and Sarıhıdır—found that mesothelioma was causing 50% of all deaths.
[13] [14] Media [ edit ] Play media A video showing the terrain of Göreme and Cappadocia The area was featured in several films due to its topography.
The 1983 Italian/French/Turkish film Yor, the Hunter from the Future was filmed in Cappadocia.
In 2010 and early 2011, the film Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance was also filmed in the Cappadocia region.
In Assassin's Creed: Revelations , Cappadocia is an underground city in Turkey which is dominated by Templars .
In the tabletop role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade , Cappadocian is an extinct clan of vampires based around Mount Erciyes.
Cappadocia's winter landscapes, and broad panoramas are prominent in the 2014 film Winter Sleep (Turkish: Kış Uykusu), directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2014 Cannes film festival.

There had been a continuous Greek presence in Cappadocia since antiquity .
[6] Following the terms of the Greek–Turkish population exchange of 1923 the remaining Cappadocian Greek natives were forced to leave and resettle in modern Greece .

In the Hellenistic era , following the conquest of Anatolia by Alexander the Great , Greek settlers began arriving in the mountainous regions of Cappadocia at this time.
[8] This Greek population movement of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC solidified a Greek presence in Cappadocia.
[9] After the death of Alexander the Great, Eumenes of Cardia , one of the Diadochi of Alexander the Great, was appointed satrap of Cappadocia, where he set up Greek settlements and distributed cities to his associates.
[10] Eumenes left behind administrators , judges and selected garrison commanders in Cappadocia.
Unlike other regions of Asia Minor where Greeks would settle in cities, most of the Greek settlements in Cappadocia and other interior Anatolian regions were villages.
[11] The Hellenistic Kings would make new Greek settlements in Cappadocia and other surrounding regions in order to secure their hold on this volatile region, [12] under their rule Greek settlements would increase in the Anatolian interior.
[12] Greek Kings of Cappadocia.

163-130 BC) who is considered to have been the greatest king of Cappadocia and was predominantly Greek by descent.
(right) Archelaus of Cappadocia (36 BC – 17 AD) was the last king of Cappadocia and was of Greek descent.
In the centuries following Alexander the Great's death, Ariarathes, the son of a Persian satrap who formerly controlled Cappadocia, gained control of Cappadocia and left it to a line of his successors, who mostly bore the name of the founder of the dynasty .
During their reign Greek towns were beginning to appear in the southern regions of Cappadocia.
[13] Ariarathes V of Cappadocia who reigned from 163 to 130 BC is considered to have been the greatest of the Kings of Cappadocia.
[14] He was predominantly Greek by descent, his father Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia was half Greek Macedonian [13] and Persian and his mother was Antiochis , was the daughter of the Seleucid Greek King Antiochus III [15] [16] of the Seleucid dynasty .
[17] By the 1st century BC, regions of Cappadocia had been ravaged by Armenian King Tigranes the Great , who had relocated a great number of Cilician and Cappadocian Greeks to Mesopotamia [18] (geographically in modern Iraq , eastern Syria and south-eastern Turkey .)
Roman Period [ edit ] Archelaus who was a Roman client prince was the last to rule as a king of Cappadocia .
He was a Cappadocian Greek nobleman , [19] [20] possibly of Macedonian descent and was the first king of Cappadocia of wholly non-Persian blood.
[21] He ruled over Cappadocia for many years before being deposed by Tiberius who took possession of Cappadocia for Rome .
[21] The region of Cappadocia produced some notable Greek individuals in antiquity, such as Apollonius of Tyana (1st century ad) who was a Greek Neo-Pythagorean philosopher [22] who became well known in the Roman Empire and Aretaeus of Cappadocia (81-138 AD) who was a native Greek, born in Cappadocia and is considered to have been one of the foremost surgeons on antiquity.

By late antiquity the Cappadocian Greeks had largely converted to Christianity .
[27] They were so thoroughly devout to Christianity that by the 1st century AD, the region of Cappadocia served as a stronghold for Christian Monasticism [28] and was of significance importance in the history of early Christianity.
[27] In the early centuries of the Common Era Cappadocia produced three prominent Greek patristic figures, known as the three hierarchs .
330-79), Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia.
[32] These Cappadocian Greek fathers of the fourth century [33] revered the ancient Greek cultural pursuit of virtue, even studying Homer and Hesiod and “ stood squarely in the tradition of Greek culture ”. [34] Byzantine Period [ edit ] By the fifth century the last of the Indo-European native languages of Anatolia ceased to be spoken, replaced by Koine Greek .
[9] At the same time the Greek communities of central Anatolia were becoming actively involved in affairs of the Byzantine Empire and some Greek Cappadocians such as Maurice Tiberius (r.582-602) and Heraclius would even serve as Emperors .
[35] [36] The region became a key Byzantine military district after the advent of Islam and the subsequent Muslim conquest of Syria led to the establishment of a militarized frontier zone (cf kleisoura and thughur ) on the border of Cappadocia.
During this period Cappadocia became crucial to the empire and produced numerous Byzantine generals, notably the Phokas clan, warlords (see Karbeas of Tephrike ), and intrigue, most importantly the Paulician heresy.
Because they were living in such a volatile region, the Cappadocian Greeks created elaborate underground cities in the volcanic formations of eastern Cappadocia and would take refuge in them during times of danger.
The Cappadocian Greeks hid in these rock-cut underground towns from many raiders over the next millennium, from 9th century Arab invaders to 11th century Turkish conquerors to 15th century Mongols.
[27] [37] [38] As late as the 20th century the local Cappadocian Greeks were still using the underground cities as refuges (Greek: καταφύγια) from periodic waves of Ottoman persecution.
[39] The most famous of these ancient underground cities are at the Cappadocian Greek villages of Anaku-Inegi (Ανακού) and Malakopi-Melagob (Μαλακοπή).
In the Middle Ages Cappadocia had hundreds of settlements and Byzantine rock-cut churches were carved out of the volcanic formations of eastern Cappadocia and decorated with painted icons, Greek writing and decorations.
[28] The Greek inhabitants of these districts of Cappadocia were called Troglodytes .
In the 10th century Leo the Deacon recorded a journey to Cappadocia by Nikephoros Phokas , in his writings he mentions that its inhabitants were called Troglodytes, in view of the fact that they “went underground in holes, clefts and labyrinths, as it were in dens and burrows”.
[41] The Byzantines re-established control of Cappadocia between the 7th and 11th centuries, during this period churches were carved into cliffs and rock faces in the Göreme and Soğanlı region.
[38] In the Middle Ages the Cappadocian Greeks would bury their religious figures in and around monasteries.
In recent years mummified bodies have been found in abandoned Greek monasteries of Cappadocia, and many, including bodies of mummified babies, are on display in the Nigde Archaeological Museum.
[42] [43] It was discovered in a sixth-century Greek chapel in the Ihlara Valley of Cappadocia.
[44] During the tenth century the Byzantine Empire had pushed east into formerly Arab-ruled lands, including most of Armenia , and had resettled thousands of Armenians into various regions of Cappadocia .
This population shift intensified ethnic tensions between the Cappadocian Greeks and the Armenian newcomers in Cappadocia, [45] and left Armenia largely devoid of native defenders.
[45] Turkish Cappadocia [ edit ] Basil Giagoupes (Bασίλειος Γιαγούπης), a 13th-century Cappadocian Greek feudatory lord who held the court title of general ( amir arzi ) in the army of Mesud II , Sultan of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum .
[53] Despite the turmoil in Anatolia, by the 13th century the Greeks of Cappadocia , Lycaonia and Pamphylia remained numerous, even under the pressure of the Turkmen nomads, possibly constituting majorities in some urban centers.
[49] During this chaotic period there is evidence that some native Cappadocian Greeks had joined the invading Turkish nomads.
Some even managing to rise to levels of prominence in the Seljuq Sultanate of Rum , such as Basil Giagoupes (Bασίλειος Γιαγούπης), a wealthy Cappadocian Greek feudatory lord of a strongly Greek district who held the court title of general ( amir arzi ) in the army of the Seljuq sultan of Konya, Mesud II .
13th century Cappadocian Greek artists were renowned for their naturalistic paintings and were employed throughout the Seljuk Empire .

Over the course of the 15th century the Ottoman Turks conquered Cappadocia from the Seljuk Turks, the Cappadocian countryside remained largely Greek populated, with a smaller Armenian population even after the Ottoman conquest.
[38] During the reign of Ottoman Sultan Murad III (1574 to 1595) the region of Cappadocia became largely Turkified in culture and language through a gradual process of acculturation, [56] [57] as a result many Greeks of Cappadocia had accepted the Turkish vernacular and later became known as ‘Karamanlides’.
This name derives from the region of Cappadocia which was called Karaman by the Turks in honor of the Turkish chieftain Karamanoglu , though the Cappadocian Greeks continued to call the region ‘ Laranda ’, its ancient Greek name.
[59] [60] Cappadocian Greeks living in remote less accessible villages of Cappadocia remained Greek-speaking and Christian, as they were isolated and consequently less affected by the rapid conversion of the bordering districts to Islam and Turkish speech.
[61] [62] The Greek Cappadocians retained the original Greek names of many regions of Cappadocia which were renamed Turkish names during the Ottoman era, such as the town known as ‘Hagios Prokopios’ in the Middle Ages, and renamed ‘ Urgup ’ by the Turks was still called ‘Prokopion’ by the local Greeks of the early 20th century.
[63] Frescoes in St. John (Gülşehir) Church, Cappadocia, Turkey.
[60] This was not a phenomenon that was limited to the Cappadocian Greek Karamanlides, as many of the Armenians living in Cappadocia were also linguistically Turkified , although they remained Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) Christians, they spoke and wrote in the Turkish language although still using the Armenian Alphabet .
[65] The Cappadocian Greeks , Armenians and Jewish minorities of the Ottoman Empire had created Graeco-Turkish, Armeno-Turkish, and Judeo-Turkish literatures by developing their own written traditions.
[66] While most Cappadocian Greeks had remained Orthodox Christians a significant number of the Karamanlides even converted to Islam during this period.
[69] Subsequent to the 1571 Ottoman conquest of Cyprus , the Ottoman Sultan Selim I decided to transfer Greeks from Cappadocia, particularly from the Kayseri region, to Cyprus .
[70] [71] During this period the architect Sinan , who was born of Greek parentage and a native of Cappadocia wrote a letter to the Sultan asking for his family to be spared from this population transfer.
[71] [72] During the Ottoman era, Cappadocian Greeks would migrate to Constantinople and other large cities to do business.
Wealthy Cappadocian Greek businessmen built large stone mansions in regions of Cappadocia such as Karvali (modern Güzelyurt ) many of which can still be seen today.
[73] [74] The Cappadocian Greeks wrote the earliest published novels in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, using the Greek Alphabet and Turkish language.
[57] Cappadocian Greeks from different regions would specialize in a particular profession, such as the caviar trade.

[77] [78] The provinces of Cappadocia and Lycaonia had a large number of Greek settlements and sizeable populations in urban centres such as Kayseri , Nigde , and Konya .
[77] The Cappadocian Greeks of the 19th and 20th centuries were renowned for the richness of their folktales and preservation of their ancient Greek tongue.
[79] The underground cities continued to be used as refuges ( Cappadocian Greek : καταφύγια) from the Turkish Muslim rulers.
” Scholars passing through Cappadocia during the 19th century described the Cappadocian Greeks and their habits.
In 1838 British scholar Robert Ainsworth wrote that "The Cappadocian Greeks are, generally speaking, pleasing and unreserved in their manners, and their conversation indicated a very high degree of intelligence and civilization, where there are so few books, and so little education, and consequently, little learning."
[80] Sir Charles William Wilson , British consul-general in Anatolia from 1879 to 1882, described their character: “ The Cappadocian Greeks have a reputation throughout Asia Minor for energy and commercial activity ; there are few towns in which a merchant from Kaisariyeh is not to be found; and the rocky nature of the country drives even the poorer classes to seek their living elsewhere.
Perhaps the most interesting trait in the character of these Greeks is their intense love of their native country; the great ambition of every man is to earn sufficient money to enable him to build a house and settle down in his beloved Cappadocia.
The south Cappadocian district, in which St. Gregory of Nazianzus once ministered, shows many signs of growing prosperity ; building is going on, and the people are vacating, for houses above ground, the subterranean villages, to which they owe the preservation of their faith and language.
[81] ” Persecution and population exchange [ edit ] By the early 1900s the region of Cappadocia was still inhabited by Christian Cappadocian Greeks as well as Muslim Turks [41] and also communities of Armenians and Kurds.
Ionian and Cappadocian Greek deaths alone totaled 397,000, while Pontian Greek deaths numbered 353,000 people.
[84] In 1924, after living in Cappadocia for thousands of years, [6] the remaining Cappadocian Greeks were expelled to Greece as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey defined by the Treaty of Lausanne , [5] the descendents of the Cappadocian Greeks who had converted to Islam were not included in the population exchange and remained in Cappadocia, [85] some still speaking the Cappadocian Greek language .
Many Cappadocian towns were greatly affected by the expulsion of the Greeks including Mustafapasa (Sinasos) , Urgup , Güzelyurt and Nevsehir as the Greeks constituted a significant percentage of the towns population.
[73] The Cappadocian Greeks were taken to the coastal town of Mersin in order to be shipped to Greece.
[73] The Cappadocian Greeks who were migrating from Cappadocia were replaced by Muslims migrating from mainland Greece, mainly from Thrace; some of these Muslims were Greeks (see Greek Muslims ), although most were of Slavic, Turkish and Gypsy origin.
Many of the Cappadocian Greek churches were converted to mosques after the Greeks left in the population exchange of the 1920s.

Following the population exchange there was still a substantial community of Cappadocian Greeks living in Turkey, in Constantinople , [60] they had settled there during the Ottoman era and formed enclaves of their native communities, [59] the majority of whom also migrated to Greece following the Anti-Greek Istanbul Pogrom riots of 1955.
On their arrival in mainland Greece, many Cappadocian Greeks settled in villages similar to their original Cappadocian villages; the new settlements were named after towns and villages left behind in Cappadocia, with the addition of the word “Nea” (New).
For example, Cappadocian Greeks from Sinasos (present Mustafapaşa near Ürgüp ) who settled in the northern part of the island of Euboea in Greece named their new settlement Nea Sinasos "New Sinasos".
[1] The regions of Greece with significant settlements of Cappadocian Greeks include the cities of Karditsa , Volos , Kilkis , Larisa , Chalkidiki , Kavala , Alexandroupoli and Thessaloniki .
[87] Today the descendents of the Cappadocian Greeks can be found throughout Greece, as well as in countries around the world particularly in Western Europe and North America and Australia as part of the Greek diaspora .
The modern region of Cappadocia is famous for the churches carved into cliffs and rock faces in the Göreme and Soğanlı valleys, [38] the region is popular with tourists, [40] many who visit the abandoned underground cities, houses and Greek churches carved and decorated by Cappadocian Greeks centuries ago.
The formerly Greek town of Güzelyurt (Karvali) has become popular with tourists who visit the abandoned stone mansions built centuries ago by wealthy Cappadocian Greek businessmen.

Main article: Cappadocian Greek The Cappadocian Greeks traditionally spoke a dialect of the Greek language known as Cappadocian Greek .
Cappadocian Greek diverged from the other Byzantine Greek dialects early, beginning with the Turkish conquests of central Asia Minor in the 11th and 12th centuries, and so developed several radical features, such as the loss of the gender for nouns.
[90] After centuries of Ottoman rule the Turkish language began to emerge as the dominant language of Cappadocia.
Many Greeks began to speak Turkish as a second language and became bilingual, this was the case with the “ Kouvoukliotes ” who were always Greek speakers and spoke Turkish with a strong Greek accent, [91] and there were Cappadocian Greeks who only spoke the Turkish language and had given up the use of Greek centuries earlier, known as the Karamanlides .
[64] At the beginning of the 20th century, the Cappadocian Greek language still had a strong presence at Gülşehir (formerly Arabison/Arapsu) north-west of Nevsehir , and in the large region southward as far down as Niğde and Bor .
[83] Many Cappadocian Greeks completely abandoned Greek when they learned Turkish, although in the western regions of Cappadocia many Greeks still retained their native language.
John Robert Sitlington Sterrett travelled through Cappadocia in 1884 and noted: " Melegobi is a large and flourishing village, inhabited almost exclusively by Greek-speaking Greeks.
The Greeks are numerous all through the western part of Cappadocia, and generally cling to their language with great tenacity, a fact worthy of notice, inasmuch as the Greeks in other parts of Asia Minor speak only Turkish.
[92] In the early 20th century scholars and linguists studying the Cappadocian Greeks observed that many Cappadocian Greek villages had begun to replace their native Greek language for the Turkish language .
The following works, in the Turkish language, but all in the Greek character, afford further proof of what I have now stated...” ( John Pinkerton , 1817) [93] In the 1920s when the Cappadocian Greeks arrived in Greece, the Cappadocian Greek spoken by them was hardly intelligible with the Demotic Greek used in mainland Greece, as it had been cut off from the rest of the Greek-speaking world for centuries.
The Cappadocian Greeks were more linguistically Turkified then the Greeks in Pontus and the western coastal regions of Turkey.
[60] Once in Greece though, they started using the modern Greek language , [66] causing their ancestral Greek dialect, the Cappadocian Greek language, to go to the brink of extinction.
The Cappadocian Greek language was believed by some scholars to have been extinct for many years.
The language was then declared alive in 2005, when descendants of Cappadocian Greeks were discovered still speaking the language fluently in central and northern Greece.
[62] Today it is still spoken by mainly elderly Cappadocian Greeks in various regions of Greece including in Karditsa, Volos, Kilkis, Larisa, Thessaloniki, Chalkidiki, Kavala, and Alexandroupoli.
[87] Some Cappadocian Greeks who converted to Islam, allowing them to avoid the population exchanges of 1923, still speak the language in their traditional homeland in Turkey.
Culture [ edit ] The Cappadocian Greeks have been isolated from the rest of the Greek-speaking world for centuries and this has made their culture , way of life, and customs somewhat distinctive.
The economy of Cappadocia was largely based upon agriculture and mining and the rural centers which lay upon the valleys and plains.
The Cappadocian Greeks have distinctive traditional songs and dances which are still performed in Greece.
Early Cappadocian Greek literature [ edit ] Cappadocian Greek children wearing traditional costumes in Greece.
The Persian poet Rumi (1207-1273), whose name means "Roman", referring to his residence amongst the "Roman" Greek speakers of Cappadocia, wrote a few poems in Cappadocian Greek.

As part of the final phase of this agreement, 44,432 Greek Orthodox Cappadocian refugees were expelled from Turkey and came to Greece as exchanged persons.
In this chapter, I describe two Cappadocian settlements: New Karvali in eastern Macedonia, northern Greece, and New Prokopi in central Greece, on the island of Evia.
Both settlements were named after places left behind in Cappadocia, with the addition of the word ‘New’.
[…]Aside from the religious dimension, the other main factor that helped the Cappadocian refugees transform their settlements from ‘space’ into a meaningful ‘place’ was that many of them were settled as communities and were not broken up and dispersed.
This allowed the transplanted people to name their settlements in Greece after their villages in Cappadocia.
[…] In the case of the Cappadocians, the notion of keeping a discrete refugee community together as one unit in the settlement process played a significant role in the refugees’ process of adaptation.
By settling near relatives and their fellow villagers from Cappadocia, these refugees were encouraged to re-create their neighborhoods.
'The so called "Asia Minor Folklore Studies" initially focused on Ottoman Cappadocia and its ethnic Greek inhabitants.
Cappadocia is an ancient district in east central Anatolia, west of the Euphrates River, where there had been a Greek presence from the Hellenistic period to the beginning of this century, when the minority group was submitted to a “population exchange”.
As the Cappadocians returned to Greece, they became absorbed by the local population and their dialect died out.
The eastern and northern part of the country beyond the Taurus was known to the Persians as Katpatuka, a name which the Greeks transformed into Cappadocia (Kappadokia).
This strip of Greek colonies was located between the mountainous regions of Pisidia, Cilicia and Cappadocia, which remained largely unconquered or were ruled by native vassals.
There were, of course, other means available to control area, According to Plutarch, when Eumenes was appointed satrap over Cappadocia he distributed cities to his friends, left behind judges (dikastai).
Most of the other settlements in the interior were villages, generally more affected by earlier Iranian–Anatolian culture…The constant border movements are reflected in the name of the region, called also ‘Cappadocia near the Pontus’ or ‘Cappadocia on the Euxine’.
The coins of Ariaramnes and Ariarathes III, with their mint-names and Greek lettering, have been taken to indicate a scattering of Greeks in the towns of south Cappadocia.
... Ariarathes V was probably the greatest of the Cappadocian kings.
Antiochis had been married to Ariarathes IV, the king of Cappadocia.
At the time in question, her son Ariarathes V, the reigning king of Cappadocia asked Lysias’ permission to rebury his mother’s and sister’s bodies in the family plot of the Cappadocian royal house.
There he had orders to wait for Tigranes, who was then employed in reducing some cities of Phoenicia; and he found means to bring over to the Roman interest many princes who submitted to the Armenian out of pure necessity… He had colonized Mesopotamia with Greeks, whom he draughted in great numbers out of Cilicia and Cappadocia.
[…] The grandson, Archelaus, was the first to have some success in Cappadocia   ^ Plutarch (2007).
This Archelaus was a native of Cappadocia, and probably of Greek stock.
…36 B.C., when Mark Antony put Archelaus, a great-grandson of one of Mithradates’ generals, on the throne – perhaps Cappadocia’s first king of wholly non-Iranian blood.
He appears to have been an able and energetic ruler, who enjoyed a long reign before being deposed in 17 A.C., when senile, by Tiberius, who annexed Cappadocia for Rome.
Apollonius was born around AD2 in Tyana (modern day Bor in southern Turkey), in the Roman province of Cappadocia.
He was born into a wealthy and respected Cappadocian Greek family, and received the best education, studying grammar and rhetoric in Tarsus, learning medicine at the temple of Aesculapius at Aegae, and philosophy at the school of Pythagoras.
Aretaeus the Cappadocian (81-138 AD) was the fourth surgeon of distinction considered during the times between Celsus and Galen.
He was a Greek, born in Cappadocia, a Roman province in Asia Minor.
Aretaeus, a Greek, was born in Cappadocia, a Roman province in Asia Minor, several centuries after Hippocrates.
Aretaeus of Cappadocia, a Greek physician who practiced in Rome and Alexandria in the second century AD, was the first to distinguish between what we now call diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.
Aretaeus of Cappadocia, a well-known Greek physician (second century AD), is credited with providing the first detailed description of an asthma attack, and to Celsus it was a disease with wheezing and noisy, violent breathing.
None the less, at the beginning of the 20th century, Greek still had a strong presence in Silli north-west of Konya (ancient Ikonion), in Pharasa and other villages in the region drained by the Yenice river (some 100 km (62 mi) south of Kayeri, ancient Caesarea), and in Cappadocia proper, at Arabison (Arapsu/Gulsehir) north-west of Nevsehir (ancient Nyssa), and in the large region south of Nevsehir as far down as Nigde and Bor (close to ancient Tyana).
During a visit from St. Paul in the first century CE, the inhabitants of Cappadocia in central Anatolia were so thoroughly converted that Cappadocia became the great stronghold of Christian monasticism..
The three great Cappadocian Fathers, called by the Greeks 'the three hierarchs ', belong to the Alexandrian school of thought.
They are Basil the Great, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia (c.

AD * Greek prelate and theologian Born of Greek parents in Cappadocia, he was educated in Caesarea, Alexandria and Athens.
Gregory of Nyssa was the brother of Basil the Great and a friend of Gregory of Nazianzus, and with them he formed the so-called Cappadocian circle of church figures and thinkers.
Thus the Cappadocian Greek fathers of the fourth century admired Origen; Maximus the Confessor was inspired by Evagrios in his spirituality; Nicodemos of Athos (eighteenth ...   ^ Woodill, Joseph (2002).
THE CAPPADOCIANS It was not before the middle of the fourth century "that the province of Cappadocia produced three great theologians, Basil of Caesarea, his friend Gregory Nazianzus and his brother Gregory of Nyssa… It is difficult to find a passage in the Cappadocians that does not make reference to the life of virtue in classical terms and language.
This is because the Cappadocian Fathers “stood squarely in the tradition of Greek culture.”…The
Cappadocian Fathers both revered the Greek cultural pursuit of virtue found for example in Homer and Hesoid and, yet, despised the myths presented in the same works.
Byzantium reverted to Greek (Maurice, born in Cappadocia, was its first Greek emperor); and trade and diplomacy were honored from the very founding of the Imperial city as never in Rome before.
Its inhabitants were Cappadocian Greeks, who may have found a refuge here, perhaps from Roman, from Iconoclast, or later from Turkish and Mongol threats.
When the Byzantines re-established secure control between the 7th and 11th centuries, the troglodyte population surfaced, now carving their churches into rock faces and cliffs in the Goreme and Sogamli areas, giving Cappadocia its fame today.
Icons continued to be painted after the Seljuk conquest of the area in the 11th century, and the Ottoman conquest did not interfere with the Christian practices in Cappadocia, where the countryside remained largely Greek, with some Armenians.

A Byzantine Settlement in Cappadocia .
The Mysteries of Cappadocia – During the Middle Ages, when Cappadocia was an important province of the Byzantine Empire, It became a vibrant area of habitation, with hundreds of settlements, churches, and monasteries carved into the rocky landscape.
Bringing together the best of the Tertiary and the Byzantine periods, the combination of scenic geological wonder and arcane art history has made Cappadocia a tourist destination of ever increasing popularity.

The tenth-century historian Leo the Deacon records a journey to Cappadocia made by Nikephoros Phokas shortly before he became emperor.
He also mentions the discovery of a mummified body of a young girl in Ihlara Valley (Peristrema), one of the most remote of the Cappadocian monastic communities and cut by the Melendiz River to the depth of 150 meters, which is where I placed Father Meletios and his friends.
In 1021 King Senekerim Artsruni of Vaspurakan ceded his kingdom to the empire and moved to Cappadocia.
The Byzantine policy of removing important lords from their Armenian lands and settling them elsewhere (principally on imperial territory, in Cappadocia and northern Mesopotamia) proved shortsighted in two respects.
Second, it exacerbated Armeno-Greek ethnic tensions by the introduction of thousands of Armenian newcomers into Cappadocia.
The decoration of cave churches in Cappadocia under Selçuk rule .
Two forced migrations of Armenians into Cappadocia have been documented.
The Greeks were rather numerous in city centers and rural areas in ancient Lycaonia, Cappadocia and Pamphylia.
The Greek communities of Cappadocia under the Seljuqs had a profound spiritual attachment to Byzantium, which formed a significant part of their communal identity.
While the Greeks of the Peloponnese, Thessaly, Epirus, Macedonia, Thrace, and west Anatolian littoral continued to speak and write in Greek, The Greeks of Cappadocia (Karaman) spoke Turkish and wrote Turkish in Greek script.
The first novels published in the Ottoman Empire in the mid-nineteenth century were by Armenians and Cappadocian Greeks; they wrote them in Turkish, using the Armenian and Greek alphabets.
Greek and Turkish-speaking men from the regions of Cappadocia and Karaman settled in the capital, forming enclaves of their native communities.
Third, the rapid conversion of the country to Islam and Turkish speech — except in the case of some remote villages of Cappadocia which remained Greek-speaking and Christian – can be explained if the former inhabitants had to return as suppliants to the new foundations   ^ a b Horrocks, Geoffrey C. (2010).
Cappadocia fell immediately under Seljuk control and, with the growth of bilingualism and conversion to Islam, its dialects began to show signs of Turkish influence and later of convergence with the dominant language.
In 2005, however, it was discovered that there were descendants of the Cappadocian refugees in central and northern Greece who still spoke their traditional language fluently.
The position of Cappadocia remains precarious, but it is certainly not yet extinct.

Many shifts of population in central Anatolia took place before the removal of the Cappadocian Greeks in the 1920s and it is quite possible that the Archangel Monastery was abandoned, perhaps for centuries, and then restored to parochial, rather than monastic, use.
(Sinan) He was born in Cappadocia, probably into a Greek Christian family.
Cappadocia .
In Cappadocia, the villages of Mustafapasa, Urgup, Guzelyurt and Nevsehir were the ones affected most by this rule.
Often more than half the population of a village had to leave the country, so that those places were hardly able to survive…The Greeks form Cappadocia were taken to Mersin on the coast in order to be shipped to Greece from there.
They were actually promised that everything would be sent after them later, but corrupt officials and numberless thieves looted the crammed storehouses, so that after a few months only a fraction of the goods or even nothing at all arrived at their new home….Today the old houses of the Greek people are the only testimony that reminds us of them in Cappadocia.
The town is an important part of the historical Cappadocia region…Much of the previously large Greek population in Güzelyurt vanished with the population exchange of the 1920s.
Young, ethnic Greek boys came down from hills of Cappadocia to work in the Istanbul caviar trade.
The Cappadocian Greeks have a reputation throughout Asia Minor for energy and commercial activity; there are few towns in which a merchant from Kaisariyeh is not to be found ; and the rocky nature of the country drives even the poorer classes to seek their living elsewhere.
Perhaps the most interesting trait in the character of these Greeks is their intense love of their native country; the great ambition of every man is to earn sufficient money to enable him to build a house and settle down in his beloved Cappadocia.
The south Cappadocian district, in which St. Gregory of Nazianzus once ministered, shows many signs of growing prosperity ; building is going on, and the people are vacating, for houses above ground, the subterranean villages, to which they owe the preservation of their faith and language.
They would be targeted both prior to and alongside the Armenians of Anatolia and Assyrians of Anatolia and Mesopotamia…The major populations of “Anatolian Greeks” include those along the Aegean coast and in Cappadocia (central Anatolia), but not the Greeks of the Thrace region west of the Bosphorus…A “Christian genocide” framing acknowledges the historic claims of Assyrian and Greek peoples, and the movements now stirring for recognition and restitution among Greek and Assyrian diasporas.
It also brings to light the quite staggering cumulative death toll among the various Christian groups targeted…of the 1.5 million Greeks of Asia minor – Ionians, Pontians, and Cappadocians – approximately 750,000 were massacred and 750,000 exiled.
The Cappadocian Greeks of the twentieth century were known not only for their preservation of the ancient tongue but also for the richness of their folktales, legends of saints, kings, heroes, and common folk that often went back through the Byzantine era to Graeco-Roman times.
R. M. Dawkins observed that the children whom he met in the villages of Cappadocia preserved among themselves the last traces and broken fragments of the art, each child telling his own special story to the others.
…in 1838 Ainsworth spoke of the regained ease, freedom and prosperity of Cappadocian Greek settlements such as Nevsehir and Incesu and arrived as a verdict which is possibly less remote from the truth than that of British castigators: "The Cappadocian Greeks are, generally speaking, pleasing and unreserved in their manners, and their conversation indicated a very high degree of intelligence and civilization, where there are so few books, and so little education, and consequently, little learning."

Numerous Greeks were to be found also in Istanbul (once, as Constantinople, the capital of the Greek Byzantine Empire), on the Black Sea coast and in the eastern province of Cappadocia, where the long-established but isolated Greek population now spoke a kind of Turkish dialect… The resulting war between the Greeks and Turks, the latter led by their great national hero, General Mustafa Kemal (later honored with the name Kemal Ataturk) ended in a definite and tragically bloody Turkish victory.
Cappadocian Greek [100] an outlying dialect of Greek spoken in a few isolated communities in the interior of Cappadocia in central Turkey, notably in Sille (Silli) near Konya, villages near Kayseri, and Faras (Pharasa) and adjacent villages, before the genocide of 1915 and the subsequent population exchanges, after which most survivors settled in Greece.
Less visited than most parts of Cappadocia, Guzelyurt (‘Beautiful Place’ in Turkish)…The next thing to visit is the Byzantine Church of St Gregory, built in AD385, restored in 1835, and then converted into a mosque when the Greeks left in the exchange of populations in the 1920s.
Even among men, very few people were fully bilingual, as opposed to speakers of Cappadocian, another Asia Minor dialect of Greek origin, where bilingualism was spread among men and women.
Cappadocian was spoken in about 32 Greek-speaking settlements in central Asia Minor before 1923, when the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey took place.
Today, there are few remaining native speakers, in certain parts of Northern Greece (in the areas of Karditsa, Volos, Kilkis, Larisa, Thessaloniki, Chalkidiki, Kavala, and Alexadroupoli), all of them descendants from Cappadocian refugees.
Cappadocia .
Right up until the last century, Greeks settled down in Cappadocia and helped shape many villages with their beautifully decorated houses… Cappadocia is not only a World Natural Heritage, but also a World Cultural Heritage, and an unusual openness to the world can be perceived here to the present day.

When the Ottomans settled in Istanbul they also adopted a number of Byzantine dishes, one of which was a form of cured beef called paston and which the Turks called pastirma …It became and remains a specialty of Kayseri in Cappadocia in west central Turkey.
Archelaus 1. (Cl BC) was a Greek general from Cappadocia who served MITHRIDATES (3) VI, king of Pontus.

Pedro El área histórica de Cappadocia no se queda atrás, con un despliegue de paisajes que muchos no dudarían encontrar en la luna: formaciones rocosas propias de un cuento de hadas, ciudades que podrían ser la escenografía de una película de fantasía y casas talladas en la roca como si se tratara de un cuento… Cappadocia se encuentra en la región central de la península de Anatolia , en Turquía .
Imagen Cappadocia Sr. Samolo A continuación, iniciamos un recorrido por algunas de las maravillas naturales de Cappadocia , un terreno en donde el hombre a lo largo de miles de años, supo adaptarse al paisaje, modelando en la roca algunas de las ciudades más increíbles del mundo, un sitio histórico de gran valor cultural reconocido como Patrimonio de la Humanidad por la Unesco.
Booking.com 1. Los paisajes de Capadocia Cappadocia comprende un paisaje modelado por miles de años por las lluvias y los vientos.
Imagen Cappadocia zz77 Los paisajes de Cappadocia se asemejan a “postales lunares” gracias a la composición de la tierra, llamada toba calcárea , una sustancia lo suficientemente débil como para ser modelada con formas caprichosas por la erosión natural y por el hombre.
Imagen Cappadocia Tania Ho Imagen Cappadocia skinnie minnie Imagen Cappadocia Tania Ho A lo largo de millones de años las cadenas montañosas se elevaron formando numerosos barrancos, cañones y depresiones que terminaron niveladas para formar un altiplano.
Lo curioso, es que la composición del suelo, de un material tan poco resistente, terminó siendo modelado a su antojo por la lluvia y el viento hasta formar los famosos valles de Cappadocia, con sus curiosas formas: Imagen Cappadocia lecu lillas Imagen Cappadocia Emre Ersahin Imagen Tania Ho Los paisajes de Capadocia , situados en una región estratégica entre numerosas rutas comerciales, fueron desde hace miles de años habitados por civilizaciones que florecieron entre los extraños paisajes, dando lugar a algunas de las ciudades y poblados más extraños e increíbles del mundo.
2. Las Ciudades de Cappadocia Los paisajes de toba calcárea resultaron ideales para que los humanos tuvieran facilidad al construir sus casas en las rocas, en formas de cuevas y cavernas.
Imagen Cappadocia Alaskan Dude Imagen Cappadocia Wadgey Las ciudades son increíbles: las casas, templos y hasta monasterios de algunas de ellas, están cavados en la roca, e incluso, algunas moradas compartidas por varias familias, se encuentran en distintos niveles dentro de una roca, como si se tratara de un edificio.
Imagen Cappadocia ccarlstead Entre las ciudades más importantes se cuentan a Aksaray, Nevşehir, Kayseri, Ürgüp, Uçhisar, Niğde, Gülşehir, y Gülağaç , aunque son muy recomendables, la ciudad de Göreme , un museo a cielo abierto que es casi un emblema de la región.
3. Las casas y templos tallados en la roca: Las casas de las ciudades y poblados de Cappadocia , cavadas en las rocas, fueron el hogar de los habitantes de la región, y se parecen a escenografías de muchas películas de ficción.
Imagen Cappadocia dachalan Desde casas, hasta templos y monasterios, muchas de las cavernas de Cappadocia continúan habitadas en la actualidad.
Imagen Cappadocia zz77 Imagen Cappadocia Alaskan Dude Las poblaciones están cercanas unas a otras, y es difícil encontrar los límites de cada lugar.
Imagen Cappadocia ogomogo Imagen Alaskan Dude Caminar por Cappadocia , nos enfrentará a cada paso , con una nueva sorpresa: las montañas tienen ventanas, y lo que desde lejos parece un paisaje desolado, es en realidad una ciudad completamente tallada en la montaña.
4. Las Chimeneas de las hadas Como si se tratara de torreones de piedra erosionados por la lluvia, las chimeneas de hada son torres con “sombrero” con alturas que pueden sobrepasar los 40 metros, una formación muy común en el paisaje de Cappadocia .
Imagen Tania Ho Imagen Cappadocia dayangchi En algunas zonas, la concentración de chimeneas de hadas es tan alta, que se transforman en puntos de interés turísticos, conocidos simplemente como Valles de las Chimeneas . 5. Cappadocia bajo la nieve Para terminar nuestro paseo, dejo una selección de imágenes bajo la nieve, un paisaje aún más increíble: Imagen Cappadocia ryan-chow Imagen Cappadocia victor nuno Imagen Cappadocia Curious Expeditions Dejo abierto un nuevo acertijo para lectores entendidos: al parecer es común encontrar árboles “decorados” por la región, que por supuesto tendrán alguna explicación: Imagen Cappadocia Emre Ersahin Información de Cappadocia en Wikipedia Compartir 1.0k 8 Share on Pinterest 5 1.
Kaymakli Underground City ( Turkish : Kaymaklı; Cappadocian Greek : Ανακού) is contained within the citadel of Kaymakli in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey .
[7] [8] After the region fell to the Ottomans the cities were used as refuges (καταφύγια) from the Turkish Muslim rulers, and as late as the 20th century the inhabitants, called Cappadocian Greeks , were still using the underground cities to escape periodic waves of Ottoman persecution.
This mine was also used by Asilikhoyuk , the oldest settlement within the Cappadocia Region.

"Anyone who attempts to find the Greek villages of Cappadocia today, either on the map or on the ground, is first faced by the problem that their names have been obliterated, a chauvinistic practice not only prevalent in modern Turkey, but practiced in Greece as well.
None the less, at the beginning of the 20th century, Greek still had a strong presence in Silli north-west of Konya (ancient Ikonion), in Pharasa and other villages in the region drained by the Yenice river (some 100km south of Kayeri, ancient Caesarea), and in Cappadocia proper, at Arabison (Arapsu/Gulsehir) north-west of Nevsehir (ancient Nyssa), and in the large region south of Nevsehir as far down as Nigde and Bor (close to ancient Tyana).
When the Byzantines re-established secure control between the 7th and 11th centuries, the troglodyte population surfaced, now carving their churches into rock faces and cliffs in the Goreme and Sogamli areas, giving Cappadocia its fame today.
Icons continued to be painted after the Seljuk conquest of the area in the 11th century, and the Ottoman conquest did not interfere with the Christian practices in Cappadocia, where the countryside remained largely Greek, with some Armenians.
Its inhabitants were Cappadocian Greeks, who may have found a refuge here, perhaps from Roman, from Iconoclast, or later from Turkish and Mongol threats.

English French Arabic Chinese Russian Spanish Japanese Dutch Göreme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia (Turkey) © Ministry of Culture and Tourism Outstanding Universal Value Brief synthesis Located on the central Anatolia plateau within a volcanic landscape sculpted by erosion to form a succession of mountain ridges, valleys and pinnacles known as “fairy chimneys” or hoodoos, Göreme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia cover the region between the cities of Nevşehir, Ürgüp and Avanos, the sites of Karain, Karlık, Yeşilöz, Soğanlı and the subterranean cities of Kaymaklı and Derinkuyu.
Though interesting from a geological and ethnological point of view, the incomparable beauty of the decor of the Christian sanctuaries makes Cappadocia one of the leading examples of the post-iconoclastic Byzantine art period.
It is believed that the first signs of monastic activity in Cappadocia date back to the 4th century at which time small anchorite communities, acting on the teachings of Basileios the Great, Bishop of Kayseri, began inhabiting cells hewn in the rock.
Cappadocian monasticism was already well established in the iconoclastic period (725-842) as illustrated by the decoration of many sanctuaries which kept a strict minimum of symbols (most often sculpted or tempera painted crosses).
However, after 842 many rupestral churches were dug in Cappadocia and richly decorated with brightly coloured figurative painting.
Criterion (i): Owing to their quality and density, the rupestral sanctuaries of Cappadocia constitute a unique artistic achievement offering irreplaceable testimony to the post-iconoclastic Byzantine art period.
Criterion (v): Cappadocia is an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement which has become vulnerable under the combined effects of natural erosion and, more recently, tourism.
Integrity Göreme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia, having been extensively used and modified by man for centuries, is a landscape of harmony combining human interaction and settlement with dramatic natural landforms.
Protection and management requirements The World Heritage property Göreme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia is subject to legal protection in accordance with both the Protection of Cultural and Natural Resources Act No. 2863 and the National Parks Act No. 2873.
