IDIOMAS Español Inglés Francés Catalán PATENTES Y MARCAS TODA LA INFORMACIÓN RELACIONADA CON LA PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL Registrar Conectar UNA PREGUNTA Y HECHO NUESTRA COMUNIDAD TE AYUDA Blog Notícia Registro de una marca en USA (Estados Unidos) 2016-11-20 10:10:41 Archivado como: Estados Unidos de América (USA) Admin @ 2016-11-20 10:10:41 El registro de una marca en Estados Unidos (USA) es vital para todos aquéllos que quieran comercializar sus productos o servicios en dicho país dónde casi la Propiedad Industrial (patentes y marcas) está muy valorada y, consecuentemente, es objeto de litigios.
A efectos prácticos, el registro de una marca en USA es muy parecido al registro de una  marca en España .
El registro de una marca en USA se puede realizar por dos vías distintas; mediante una solicitud de marca nacional o bien mediante la designación de USA en una marca Internacional .
¿Cuándo se debe registrar una Marca nacional (USA) en lugar de una Marca Internacional ?
¿Cómo puedo saber si una marca esta registrada en USA? ¿Cómo es el  procedimiento de una marca en USA?
Para decidir si registrar una marca nacional en USA, cabe tener en cuenta lo siguiente: Pretendes utilizar la marca en algún país acogido a la Marca Internacional aparte de USA.
Si la respuesta es Sí y el número de países a parte de USA dónde deseas tener protección es superior a 2, lo recomendable es registrar una marca Internacional.
En caso contrario es recomendable el registro directamente en USA.
Para conocer si una marca ya esta registrada en USA se puede hacer uso de nuestro  localizador de marcas aquí .
La tramitación de una marca en USA es recomendable realizarla a través de un profesional en propiedad industrial, como  Volartpons , que te asesorará sobre qué vía de registro seguir así como preparará toda la documentación necesaria para evitar recibir problemas durante la tramitación.
http://www.patentes-y-marcas.com/profesionales/asesores-en-propiedad-industrial/estados-unidos/1?q=box Juan gonzalez 2016-11-03 04:23:45 como puedo registrar una idea en EU, soy de miami, donde puedoir y cuales son los pasos a seguir Silvia Lira Sil 2016-09-11 05:11:03 Si ya tengo registrada una marca en Estados Unidos y la quiero usar en México la puedo introducir por medio del TLC? O será más conveniente hacerla marca internacional desde Estados Unidos?
Admin 2016-08-03 11:29:48 Se puede obtener protección sobre una marca en USA a través de un registro nacional directamente en USA o a través de la marca internacional.
Si es así probablemente te salga más a cuenta el registro de una marca internacional designando USA y los otros países donde deseas protección.
Alberto perea 2016-05-06 09:03:30 Si yo solo necesito registrar mi marca en un estado de Usa como lo hago?
Iñigo 2015-06-23 19:44:25 Nosotros vendemos maquinaria agrícola en USA y nuestro distribuidor nos exige tener registrada la marca.
Nuestro distribuidor en USA nos exigía el registro de la marca en Estados Unidos para trabajar para nosotros.
karen 2014-11-07 20:38:59 hola que tal solicitando de sus servicios para poder continuar con el registro de patente en estados unidos si me urge por los terminos que el impi otorga muchas gracias y espero me contacten 3315230412 Volartpons 2014-10-23 09:36:49 Buenos días, si deseas que te informemos sobre cómo registrar tu marca en USA nos puedes llamar al 933182440 o enviarnos un email a volartpons@volartpons.com
La verdad es que trabajamos mucho en USA por lo que la experiencia nos da alguna ventaja.
Registraron mi marca en Usa rápidamente y a un precio aceptable.
Un saludo a todos y suerte en el mercado de USA.
Las estadísticas sobre el número de suspensos de marcas en USA son alarmantes.
Maite 2014-03-13 11:58:24 Registrar una marca en USA es muy complicado.
Por desgracia no me han recomendado registrar mi marca en USA debido a no se que prohibición.
Lupo 2013-12-19 12:21:07 En Usa es muy dificil registrar una marca.
Parece que la Oficina de Usa siempre encuntra un motivo de suspenso para que tu como titular contrates los eervicios de un agente de Usa.
La verdad que sus precios para Usa me sorprendieron.
No es la primera vez que registro una marca en Usa y la verdad se agradece unos precios mas ajustadoa.
Ademas no recibi ningun suspenso durante la tramitacion, cosa extraña en el registro de una marca en Usa.
The other islands of the Northern Marianas are sparsely inhabited; the most notable among these is Pagan , which for various reasons over the centuries has experienced major population flux, but formerly had residents numbering in the thousands.
That allowed garments to be labeled "Made in USA" without having to comply with all U.S. labor laws.
