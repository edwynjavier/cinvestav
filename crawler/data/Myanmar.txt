Pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988 were violently crushed, with general Saw Maung taking over in a coup and installing the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to rule the country, now renamed Myanmar .
In response to the government's attack in May 2003 on Aung San Suu Kyi and her convoy, the USA imposed new economic sanctions against Myanmar, including bans on imports of products from Myanmar and on provision of financial services by US citizens.
Culture [ edit ] Pagodas and temples in present-day Bagan ( Pagan ), the capital of the thousand year old Pagan Empire Myanmar's culture is heavily influenced by Buddhism.
People [ edit ] The dominant ethnic group in Myanmar is known as the Bamar, from which the original English name of the country, Burma, was derived.
Besides the Bamar, Myanmar is also home to many minority ethnic groups and nationalities which have their own distinct cultures and languages.
In addition to the native ethnic minorities, Myanmar is also home to ethnic Chinese and Indians whose ancestors migrated to Myanmar during the colonial period, most visible in the cities of Yangon and Mandalay.
Generally speaking, the divisions in Myanmar are Bamar-dominated, while the states are dominated by the respective ethnic minorities.
Because the government is slowly becoming more progressive, many of Myanmar's people have made efforts to inform themselves of domestic and international events, and it is increasingly common for people to be willing to discuss politics.
If you are traveling with the intention of learning about Myanmar's government, society, and economy, you will have a much easier time finding knowledgeable laypeople than you would in China or even in Thailand.
Climate [ edit ] Myanmar is considered to have three seasons.
Generally, Lower Myanmar, the area around Yangon, receives more rainfall than the drier Upper Myanmar (around Mandalay).
Easily the most accessible history of Myanmar available.

The duration of your stay in Myanmar is 28 days from the date of arrival.
Successful applicants will also be issued an "Arrival Form", which will be stapled into your passport and must be presented on arrival in Myanmar, along with your passport containing the visa sticker.
You must enter Myanmar through international airports and not through the border.
The only type of visa issued through the e-Visa service, however, is a single-entry tourist visa for US$50 or business visa for $70, both valid for entry during the 90 days after issuance, and permits a 28 days (tourist visa), 70 days (business visa) stay in Myanmar.
As of September 1, 2016, the e-Visa can be used to enter Myanmar also from the following three land border checkpoints: Tachileik Myawaddy Kawthaung Note that it is not yet possible to enter trough Htee Khee border checkpoint with the e-Visa, but this is likely to be changed in the future as soon as the area gets properly connected to the Internet.
Myanmar has announced the resumption of Visa-On-Arrival (VOA) starting in June 2012 for several countries including all ASEAN member states, the EU, New Zealand and the USA.
Note that, according to the Myanmar government website there is no VOA for tourists, but Myanmar Airways claims that VOA is now available for tourists of all nationalities for USD30 (as of February 2013), but only on flights with their airline from Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Guangzhou.
The best advice is to check on the Myanmar visa website well before travel and select the best method of applying for a visa.
Note that the Myanmar Embassy is closed for all Thai and Myanmar official holidays.
The Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok is open 09:00-12:00 and 15:30-16:30.
KUALA LUMPUR The Myanmar Embassy in Kuala Lumpur issues 28-day tourist visas.
(Update) Now, do not go to Myanmar Embassy at Jalan Ampang Hilir for visa application.
Now, you have to go again to the Myanmar Embassyto get the tourist visa.
HANOI The Myanmar embassy in Hanoi issues visas to tourists with a processing time of 4 business days and a USD20 fee (as of September 2013).
VIENTIANE The Myanmar embassy in Vientiane issues 28-day tourist visa within 1 day (apply one weekday, pick up the next day) for USD20 and no other documents required than passport, 3 photos, a form filled 2 times.
Myanmar is now going through a lot of growth in which they might not meet their 10 business day processing time.
KOLKATA You can get a visa from the Myanmar Consulate at 57K Ballygunge Circular Road in Kolkata .
You have three months to enter Myanmar and it is valid for one month.
By plane [ edit ] As of August 2014 flights into Myanmar are available from several countries and it shows up as a destination in the popular web search engines.
By land [ edit ] The situation has changed since the 28 Aug 2013, it's now possible to enter Myanmar freely by land from 4 Thai/Myanmar border crossings - Tachileik / Mae Sai , Myawaddy / Mae Sot , Phu Nam Ron / Htee Khee and Kawthoung / Ranong , see Myanmar Geneva Thai Border .
Alert - entering Myanmar without correct entry stamp If you miss your entry stamp on your passport and get caught by immigration officials on a later destination, it’s up to you whether you become either a subject to be returned back to your point of entry by Myanmar immigration laws, or a cash cow for the officials in form of bribery for them to turn a blind eye to ”YOUR MISTAKE”.
If you ask them whether it would be possible them to correct the mistake as they belong to the same agency as the officials at your point of entry, you will get an answer that it is not possible by the Myanmar immigration laws (which is likely to be exactly to the point).
It will take considerably more time but in the end you will get there, and will cost you only the travel costs so far in Myanmar.
Hopping across the Thai border into Myanmar's border towns is easy, but crossing into or out of Myanmar proper by land still varies by border (see below).
Thailand : For all the land borders, you'll need to get a Myanmar Visa beforehand.
You can obtain it in the Embassy of Myanmar in Bangkok, or apply for the e-Visa (except Phu Nam Ron / Htee Khee ), see the Visa information above.
Tachileik / Mae Sai - You can now cross this border and travel into Myanmar, but you cannot continue on land and need to take a flight to reach the other open area.
Since the new road from Myawaddy towards Hpa-An opened in July 2015, circulation is now running in both directions every day and travel time to inner Myanmar has been cut by 2 hours.
Phu Nam Ron / Htee Khee - This is the most direct border from Bangkok into southern Myanmar.
The Myanmar side is a wide gravel road with good condition by most parts through the natural jungle, it only takes 4 to 5 hours to arrive in Dawei.
Kawthoung / Ranong - You can cross this border and travel into Myanmar by bus (to Myeik ), boat (to Myeik or Dawei ) or plane into the rest of the country.
India - a land border crossing exists between India and Myanmar at Moreh/ Tamu .
This permit is required by Myanmar, to enter and to exit that border.
It also seems to be possible from outside Myanmar through the agency " Exotic Myanmar Travels ", it costs 50 USD, allow at least 3 weeks to process.
There is also a crossing between India and Myanmar in the far north called Pangsau Pass, named for the neighboring Burmese town of Pangsau.
Three times a month, Indian nationals are allowed to cross into Myanmar to exchange goods at the market in Pangsau, but the crossing is emphatically closed to foreigners.
Bangladesh / Laos - it is currently not possible to cross the borders between Myanmar and Bangladesh or Laos.
Get around [ edit ] Myanmar's infrastructure is being built.
However, much of Myanmar is closed to foreign travellers, and many land routes to far-flung areas are also closed (for example, to Mrauk U , Kalewa , Putao , Kengtung ).
Requests to visit restricted areas must be made at the MTT (Myanmar Travel and Tours) office in Yangon (Number 77-91, Sule Pagoda Road, Yangon, currently no website available).

Please note that many airlines engage in the unfortunate practice of dual pricing, with foreigners paying significantly more than Myanmar nationals.
State owned and appallingly run Myanmar National Airlines (UB) - not to be confused with Myanmar Airways International (8M) "MAI".
There are also privately owned airlines serving the main domestic routes in Myanmar.
They are: Air Bagan (W9) - has e-ticketing (Air Bagan has stopped flights in 2015 and is now code sharing with Asian Wings) Asian Wings - has e-ticketing Air Mandalay (6T) Mann Yadanapron Airlines - has e-ticketing Golden Myanmar Airways (good rates between Yangon and Mandalay on Boeing jets) - has e-ticketing Yangon Airways (YH) Air KBZ - has e-ticketing While slightly more expensive, they are a safer option and would get you to all the main tourist destinations from Yangon or Mandalay.
The table below gives some example rates for Air Bagan and Air Mandalay (Sep 2015) between most visited places in Myanmar (note: these are high season prices, and usually the fare in the opposite direction is the same price.
Check for more up to date rates!) Example fares between important destinations (through local tourist agency) From To Approximate fare Yangon Mandalay USD105 Yangon Bagan USD95 Bagan Heho USD65 Heho Yangon USD112 Yangon Myeik USD240 By train [ edit ] Myanmar has an extensive but ancient rail network.
Trains in lower Myanmar (Yangon - Pathein and Yangon - Mawlymaing) are little communities of their own with hawkers selling everything imaginable.
The most used line is the 325km line from Yangon to Mandalay with several trains a day (this is also the only double line in Myanmar), and the only one that is competitive in time with buses (note that the fastest trains take 15 hours for the 385km run, an effective rate of 25km/hour!).
The following table summarizes travel time and prices between most visitable places in Myanmar (note: prices are approximate, check with more up to date and reliable sources!): Train travel times and fares between important destinations From To Time Ordinary Upper Sleeper Yangon Mandalay 16 hrs US$15 US$30 US$40-50 Yangon Kyaiktiyo 6 hrs US$-- US$9 None Mandalay Pyin U Lwin 4 hrs US$2 US$4 None Pyin U Lwin Hsipaw 7 hrs US$2 US$6 None Myanmar Railways Round Trip takes 2.5 hours to visit Yangon.
By far, the most common issue that tourists have with Myanmar's trains is the constant rocking and shaking.
By bus [ edit ] Buses of all types, from small to big, atrocious to luxurious, run the roads of Myanmar.Since the ban on importing vehicles was lifted in 2012, the quality of coach transport has improved drastically.High quality Swedish Scania coaches regularly run the Mandalay - Yangon route while lesser vehicles can get travelers to other places.
The following table summarizes travel times and approximate fares between important tourist destinations in Myanmar (Note: most bus fares have gone up with the recent fuel price rises, the fares listed here are rough estimates): Bus Travel times and fares between important destinations.

Unlike most of the developing world, in Myanmar, there are ATMs in nearly every big town, especially in all the major tourist areas.
With the opening of Myanmar's economy and easing of sanctions, bills in non-perfect condition are acceptable as long as they are in reasonably good shape (eg.

The traditional centre of Lacquerware production though is Bagan in central Myanmar .
Precious stones Myanmar is a significant miner of jade, rubies and sapphire (the granting of a license to the French over the ruby mines in Mogok was one of the causes leading to the Third Burmese War) and these can be obtained at a fraction of what they would cost in the West.

Myanmar has a problem providing enough electricity to its people and Power outages are common(As of Jan 2015 there is some improvement).To avoid spending your nights without a fan or air-conditioning, ask if the hotel has a generator (most mid-priced hotels do).
Work [ edit ] Work in Myanmar for foreigners is hard to come by.
If you would like to work and assist Burmese refugees certain NGOs [12] work in neighbouring Thailand Stay safe [ edit ] Crime [ edit ] Myanmar is one of the safest countries in the developing world for tourists to visit, mainly because of the strict Buddhist culture but in part because of the government's Draconian punishments for those who trouble foreigners.
Should you be the victim of a crime, there are police stations all over the country which fly Myanmar's flag and have signs, oftentimes in both English and Burmese, that read: "Can I help you?"
The police officers in Myanmar are not always up to Western standards, but they are very helpful, and can generally be counted on to get the job done.

Myanmar ( Burmese pronunciation:  [mjəmà] ), [nb 1] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and also known as Burma , is a sovereign state in South East Asia bordered by Bangladesh , India , China , Laos and Thailand .
About one third of Myanmar's total perimeter of 5,876 km (3,651 miles), forms an uninterrupted coastline of 1,930 km (1,200 miles) along the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea .
[11] Myanmar is 676,578 square kilometres (261,227 sq mi) in size.
[1] Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman -speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma .
[13] The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well.
The British conquered Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony .
Myanmar became an independent nation in 1948 , initially as a democratic nation and then, following a coup d'état in 1962 , a military dictatorship .
Myanmar is a country rich in jade and gems , oil , natural gas and other mineral resources.
[3] The income gap in Myanmar is among the widest in the world, as a large proportion of the economy is controlled by supporters of the former military government.
[22] [23] As of 2014 [update] , according to the Human Development Index (HDI), Myanmar had a low level of human development, ranking 148 out of 188 countries.

Myanmar is considered to be the literary form of the name of the group, while Burma is derived from "Bamar", the colloquial form of the group's name.
[29] [30] Official United States policy retains Burma as the country's name, although the State Department 's website lists the country as "Burma (Myanmar)" and Barack Obama has referred to the country by both names.
[31] [32] [33] The Czech Republic uses officially Myanmar, although its Ministry of Foreign Affairs mentions both Myanmar and Burma on its website.
[34] The United Nations uses Myanmar , as do the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , Australia , [35] Russia , Germany , [36] China , India , Norway , [37] Japan [29] and Switzerland .
[38] Most English-speaking international news media refer to the country by the name Myanmar , including the BBC , [39] CNN , [40] Al Jazeera , [41] Reuters , [42] RT (Russia Today) and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)/ Radio Australia .
[43] [44] Myanmar is known as "Birmania" in Spanish, Italian and Romanian – Birmania being the local version of Burma .
Myanmar used to be known as "Birmânia" in Portuguese, and as "Birmanie" in French.
[45] Brazil , Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries, as well as France and other French-speaking countries, now use mainly "Myanmar".
[46] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Myanmar Prehistory [ edit ] Main articles: Prehistory of Myanmar and Migration period of ancient Burma Pyu city-states c. 8th century; Pagan is shown for comparison only and is not contemporary.
Archaeological evidence shows that Homo erectus lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as 750,000 years ago, with no more erectus finds after 75,000 years ago.
[47] [48] The first evidence of Homo sapiens is dated to about 11,000 BC, in a Stone Age culture called the Anyathian with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar.
This indicates some form of communication between groups in Myanmar and other places, possibly through trade.
[54] Early city-states [ edit ] Main articles: Pyu city-states and Mon kingdoms Around the second century BC the first-known city-states emerged in central Myanmar.
The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman -speaking Pyu city-states , the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are extant, from present-day Yunnan .
In 1527, the Confederation of Shan States conquered Ava itself, and ruled Upper Myanmar until 1555.
It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim .
From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na.
In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom .
After the fall of Ava, the Konbaung–Hanthawaddy War involved one resistance group under Alaungpaya defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759, he had reunited all of Myanmar and Manipur, and driven out the French and the British, who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy.
[73] [74] Following World War II, Aung San negotiated the Panglong Agreement with ethnic leaders that guaranteed the independence of Myanmar as a unified state.
In 1947, Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Myanmar, a transitional government.
Between 1962 and 1974, Myanmar was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general.
[81] During this period, Myanmar became one of the world's most impoverished countries.
[83] SLORC changed the country's official English name from the "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" to the "Union of Myanmar" in 1989.
On 23 June 1997, Myanmar was admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

[92] In the critical days following this disaster, Myanmar's isolationist government was accused of hindering United Nations recovery efforts.
[94] In early August 2009, a conflict known as the Kokang incident broke out in Shan State in northern Myanmar.
[96] [97] [98] Civil wars [ edit ] Main articles: Internal conflict in Myanmar , Kachin Conflict , Karen conflict , and 2015 Kokang offensive Civil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmar's socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948.
Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which Myanmar's civil wars continue.
[99] In October 2012, the ongoing conflicts in Myanmar included the Kachin conflict , [100] between the Pro-Christian Kachin Independence Army and the government; [101] [102] a civil war between the Rohingya Muslims, and the government and non-government groups in Rakhine State ; [103] and a conflict between the Shan , [104] [105] Lahu , and Karen [106] [107] minority groups, and the government in the eastern half of the country.
In addition, al-Qaeda signalled an intention to become involved in Myanmar.
In a video released on 3 September 2014, mainly addressed to India , the militant group's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri said al-Qaeda had not forgotten the Muslims of Myanmar and that the group was doing "what they can to rescue you".
[109] Armed conflict between ethnic Chinese rebels and the Myanmar Armed Forces have resulted in the Kokang offensive in February 2015.
As part of the referendum process, the name of the country was changed from the "Union of Myanmar" to the "Republic of the Union of Myanmar", and general elections were held under the new constitution in 2010.
[116] The impact of the post-election reforms has been observed in numerous areas, including ASEAN's approval of Myanmar's bid for the position of ASEAN chair in 2014; [117] the visit by United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in December 2011 for the encouragement of further progress, which was the first visit by a Secretary of State in more than fifty years, [118] during which Clinton met with the Burmese president and former military commander Thein Sein , as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi; [119] and the participation of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party in the 2012 by-elections, facilitated by the government's abolition of the laws that previously barred the NLD.

Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Myanmar A map of Myanmar Myanmar map of Köppen climate classification.
Myanmar has a total area of 678,500 square kilometres (262,000 sq mi).
As of February 2011, Myanmar consisted of 14 states and regions, 67 districts, 330 townships, 64 sub-townships, 377 towns, 2,914 Wards, 14,220 village tracts and 68,290 villages.
Hkakabo Razi , located in Kachin State , at an elevation of 5,881 metres (19,295 ft), is the highest point in Myanmar.
[127] Many mountain ranges, such as the Rakhine Yoma , the Bago Yoma , the Shan Hills and the Tenasserim Hills exist within Myanmar, all of which run north-to-south from the Himalayas .
[128] The mountain chains divide Myanmar's three river systems, which are the Irrawaddy , Salween (Thanlwin) , and the Sittaung rivers.
[129] The Irrawaddy River, Myanmar's longest river, nearly 2,170 kilometres (1,348 mi) long, flows into the Gulf of Martaban .
[128] The majority of Myanmar's population lives in the Irrawaddy valley, which is situated between the Rakhine Yoma and the Shan Plateau.
Administrative divisions [ edit ] Main article: Administrative divisions of Myanmar Myanmar is divided into seven states ( ပြည်နယ် ) and seven regions ( တိုင်းဒေသကြီး ), formerly called divisions.

Annual rainfall in the delta region is approximately 2,500 mm (98.4 in), while average annual rainfall in the Dry Zone in central Myanmar is less than 1,000 mm (39.4 in).
The Northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average temperatures of 21 °C (70 °F).
[129] Environment [ edit ] Myanmar continues to perform badly in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 153 out of 180 countries in 2016; among the worst in the South Asian region, only ahead of Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Despite several issues, Myanmar also ranks 64 and scores very good (ie.
[132] [133] Wildlife [ edit ] Myanmar's slow economic growth has contributed to the preservation of much of its environment and ecosystems .
Forests, including dense tropical growth and valuable teak in lower Myanmar, cover over 49% of the country, including areas of acacia , bamboo , ironwood and Magnolia champaca .
In much of central Myanmar (the Dry Zone), vegetation is sparse and stunted.
Typical jungle animals, particularly Tigers , occur sparsely in Myanmar.
In upper Myanmar, there are rhinoceros , Wild water buffalo , Clouded leopard , Wild boars , Deer , Antelope , and Elephants , which are also tamed or bred in captivity for use as work animals, particularly in the lumber industry .

Government and politics [ edit ] Main article: Politics of Myanmar Assembly of the Union (Pyidaungsu Hluttaw) The constitution of Myanmar, its third since independence, was drafted by its military rulers and published in September 2008.
Myanmar's army-drafted constitution was approved in a referendum in May 2008.
[143] Myanmar rates as a corrupt nation on the Corruption Perceptions Index with a rank of 157th out of 177 countries worldwide and a rating of 2.1 out of 10 (10 being least corrupt and 0 being highly corrupt) as of 2012 [update] .
[144] Foreign relations [ edit ] Main article: Foreign relations of Myanmar Myanmar President Thein Sein meets US President Barack Obama in Yangon , 2012.
After years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military sanctions, [145] the United States relaxed curbs on foreign aid to Myanmar in November 2011 [119] and announced the resumption of diplomatic relations on 13 January 2012 [146] The European Union has placed sanctions on Myanmar, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences , and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid .
[148] On 13 April 2012 British Prime Minister David Cameron called for the economic sanctions on Myanmar to be suspended in the wake of the pro-democracy party gaining 43 seats out of a possible 45 in the 2012 by-elections with the party leader, Aung San Suu Kyi becoming a member of the Burmese parliament.
Under India's Look East policy , fields of co-operation between India and Myanmar include remote sensing , [150] oil and gas exploration, [151] information technology, [152] hydro power [153] and construction of ports and buildings.
[154] In 2008, India suspended military aid to Myanmar over the issue of human rights abuses by the ruling junta, although it has preserved extensive commercial ties, which provide the regime with much-needed revenue.
[156] International relations progress indicators continued in September 2012 when Aung San Suu Kyi visited to the US [157] followed by Myanmar's reformist president visit to the United Nations .
[158] In May 2013, Thein Sein became the first Myanmar president to visit the White House in 47 years; the last Burmese leader to visit the White House was Ne Win in September 1966.
President Barack Obama praised the former general for political and economic reforms, and the cessation of tensions between Myanmar and the United States.
Political activists objected to the visit due to concerns over human rights abuses in Myanmar but Obama assured Thein Sein that Myanmar will receive US support.
The two leaders discussed to release more political prisoners, the institutionalisation of political reform and rule of law, and ending ethnic conflict in Myanmar—the two governments agreed to sign a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement on 21 May 2013.
[159] In June 2013, Myanmar held its first ever summit, the World Economic Forum on East Asia 2013.
[160] Military [ edit ] Main article: Armed forces of Myanmar A Myanmar Air Force Mikoyan MiG-29 multirole fighter.
Myanmar has received extensive military aid from China in the past [161] Myanmar has been a member of ASEAN since 1997.
[162] In November 2008, Myanmar's political situation with neighbouring Bangladesh became tense as they began searching for natural gas in a disputed block of the Bay of Bengal.
[163] Controversy surrounding the Rohingya population also remains an issue between Bangladesh and Myanmar.
[164] Myanmar's armed forces are known as the Tatmadaw , which numbers 488,000.
[27] The military is very influential in Myanmar, with all top cabinet and ministry posts usually held by military officials .
Estimates vary widely because of uncertain exchange rates, but Myanmar's military forces' expenses are high.
[165] Myanmar imports most of its weapons from Russia, Ukraine, China and India.
Myanmar is building a research nuclear reactor near Pyin Oo Lwin with help from Russia.
[166] [167] In 2010 as part of the Wikileaks leaked cables, Myanmar was suspected of using North Korean construction teams to build a fortified Surface-to-Air Missile facility.
[168] Until 2005, the United Nations General Assembly annually adopted a detailed resolution about the situation in Myanmar by consensus.
[169] [170] [171] [172] But in 2006 a divided United Nations General Assembly voted through a resolution that strongly called upon the government of Myanmar to end its systematic violations of human rights.
[173] In January 2007, Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution before the United Nations Security Council [174] calling on the government of Myanmar to respect human rights and begin a democratic transition.
[175] Human rights and internal conflicts [ edit ] Main articles: Human rights in Myanmar and Internal conflict in Myanmar This article's factual accuracy may be compromised due to out-of-date information .
(January 2013) There is consensus that former military regime in Myanmar (1962–2010) was one of the world's most repressive and abusive regimes.
[104] Members of the United Nations and major international human rights organisations have issued repeated and consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Myanmar.
[179] International human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch , [180] Amnesty International [181] and the American Association for the Advancement of Science [182] have repeatedly documented and condemned widespread human rights violations in Myanmar.
[187] The UN's Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Radhika Coomaraswamy , who stepped down from her position a week later, met representatives of the Government of Myanmar on 5 July 2012 and stated that she hoped the government's signing of an action plan would "signal a transformation."
[188] In September 2012, the Myanmar Armed Forces released 42 child soldiers and the International Labour Organization met with representatives of the government as well as the Kachin Independence Army to secure the release of more child soldiers.
[104] A Bangkok Post article on 23 December 2012 reported that the Myanmar Armed Forces continued to use child soldiers including during the army's large offensive against the KIA in December 2012.
[16] In 2007 the international movement to defend women's human rights issues in Myanmar was said to be gaining speed.
[191] Genocide allegations and crimes against Rohingya people [ edit ] Rohingya people of Myanmar displaced by decades long human rights abuses.
More than 100,000 Rohingyas in Myanmar continue to live in camps for internally displaced persons .
See also: Rohingya insurgency in Western Myanmar and 2013 Myanmar anti-Muslim riots The Rohingya people have consistently faced human rights abuses by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as Burmese citizens (despite some of them having lived in Burma for over three generations)—the Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law.
Associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in Myanmar before 1823, but can prove they have one grandparent, or pre-1823 ancestor, who was a citizen of another country, as well as people who applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws.
[194] As of July 2012, the Myanmar Government does not include the Rohingya minority group—classified as stateless Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982—on the government's list of more than 130 ethnic races and, therefore, the government states that they have no claim to Myanmar citizenship.
[205] A UN envoy reported in March 2013 that unrest had re-emerged between Myanmar's Buddhist and Muslim communities, with violence spreading to towns that are located closer to Yangon.
An estimated 100,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar in the last two years in fear of persecution and violence.
[211] [213] [214] According to the Myanmar authorities, the violence, between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and thousands of homes destroyed.
[213] [217] A number of monks' organisations that played a vital role in Myanmar's struggle for democracy have taken measures to block any humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya community.
[218] Freedom of speech [ edit ] Main article: Censorship in Myanmar Restrictions on media censorship were significantly eased in August 2012 following demonstrations by hundreds of protesters who wore shirts demanding that the government "Stop Killing the Press."
[220] Praise for the 2011 government reforms [ edit ] According to the Crisis Group , [221] since Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011, the country's human rights record has been improving.
Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7, the 2012 Freedom in the World report also notes improvement, giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights, the release of political prisoners, and a loosening of restrictions.
[222] In 2013, Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of five in civil liberties and a six in political freedoms [223] The government has assembled a National Human Rights Commission that consists of 15 members from various backgrounds.
[224] Several activists in exile, including Thee Lay Thee Anyeint members, have returned to Myanmar after President Thein Sein's invitation to expatriates to return home to work for national development.
[225] In an address to the United Nations Security Council on 22 September 2011, Myanmar's Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin confirmed the government's intention to release prisoners in the near future.
[228] A 2011 report by the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations found that, while contact with the Myanmar government was constrained by donor restrictions, international humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) see opportunities for effective advocacy with government officials, especially at the local level.
[229] 2013 onwards [ edit ] Following Thein Sein's first ever visit to the UK and a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron , the Myanmar president declared that all of his nation's political prisoners will be released by the end of 2013, in addition to a statement of support for the well-being of the Rohingya Muslim community.
In a speech at Chatham House , he revealed that "We [Myanmar government] are reviewing all cases.
I guarantee to you that by the end of this year, there will be no prisoners of conscience in Myanmar.", in addition to expressing a desire to strengthen links between the UK and Myanmar's military forces.
(October 2014) There have been reports that Myanmar is interested in or may be developing nuclear weapons .
[231] These reports are based on evidence gathered from anti-government Burmese [232] and on reports that North Korea may be exporting nuclear technology to Myanmar.
Myanmar is a signatory to a special ASEAN treaty that bans all types of nuclear weapons in signatory states in Southeast Asia.
[233] [234] Economy [ edit ] Main article: Economy of Myanmar Further information: Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia) , Transport in Myanmar , and Oil and gas industry in Myanmar A proportional representation of Burma's exports.
Myanmar is one of the poorest nations in Southeast Asia, suffering from decades of stagnation, mismanagement and isolation.
The lack of an educated workforce skilled in modern technology hinders Myanmar's economy, although recent reforms and developments carried out by the new government, in collaboration with foreign countries and organisations aim to make this a thing of the past.
[235] Myanmar lacks adequate infrastructure.
[236] Highways are normally unpaved, except in the major cities. [236] In 2010–2011, Bangladesh exported products worth $9.65 million to Myanmar against its import of $179 million.
[237] The annual import of medicine and medical equipment to Myanmar during the 2000s was 160 million USD. [238] In recent years, both China and India have attempted to strengthen ties with the government for economic benefit.
Many nations, including the United States and Canada, and the European Union, have imposed investment and trade sanctions on Myanmar.
[240] Rice is Myanmar's largest agricultural product.
Economic history [ edit ] Under British administration, Myanmar was the second-wealthiest country in South-East Asia.
Myanmar also had a wealth of natural and labour resources.
Myanmar was bombed extensively by both sides.
The catastrophic programme turned Myanmar into one of the world's most impoverished countries.
[82] Myanmar's admittance to least developed country status by the UN in 1987 highlighted its economic bankruptcy.
[244] In Myanmar, political and economic ideological struggles have affected living standards.
Decades of civil war and unrest have contributed to Myanmar's current levels of poverty and lack of economic progress.
[245] Agriculture [ edit ] Further information: Agriculture in Myanmar The major agricultural product is rice, which covers about 60% of the country's total cultivated land area.
[247] Drug production [ edit ] Myanmar is also the world's second largest producer of opium , accounting for 25% of entire world production and is a major source of illegal drugs , including amphetamines .
[249] Natural resources [ edit ] Myanmar produces precious stones such as rubies , sapphires , pearls , and jade .
Myanmar's "Valley of Rubies", the mountainous Mogok area, 200 km (120 mi) north of Mandalay , is noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires.
[251] The government of Myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines.
Myanmar Engineering Society has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to Yangon which is a significant underutilized resource for electrical production.
[253] Tourism [ edit ] Main article: Tourism in Myanmar Stilt houses at Inle Lake .
Since 1992, the government has encouraged tourism in the country; however, fewer than 270,000 tourists entered the country in 2006 according to the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board.
[254] Myanmar's Minister of Hotels and Tourism Saw Lwin has stated that the government receives a significant percentage of the income of private sector tourism services.
[255] The most popular available tourist destinations in Myanmar include big cities such as Yangon and Mandalay ; religious sites in Mon State , Pindaya , Bago and Hpa-An ; nature trails in Inle Lake , Kengtung , Putao , Pyin Oo Lwin ; ancient cities such as Bagan and Mrauk-U ; as well as beaches in Nabule , [256] Ngapali , Ngwe-Saung , Mergui .
[257] Nevertheless, much of the country is off-limits to tourists, and interactions between foreigners and the people of Myanmar, particularly in the border regions, are subject to police scrutiny.
They are not to discuss politics with foreigners, under penalty of imprisonment and, in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit "unnecessary contact" between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people.
[259] According to the website Lonely Planet , getting into Myanmar is problematic: "No bus or train service connects Myanmar with another country, nor can you travel by car or motorcycle across the border – you must walk across.",
and states that, "It is not possible for foreigners to go to/from Myanmar by sea or river."
[259] There are a small number of border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles, such as the border between Ruili (China) to Mu-se , the border between Htee Kee (Myanmar) and Phu Nam Ron (Thailand) —the most direct border between Dawei and Kanchanaburi , and the border between Myawaddy (Myanmar) and Mae Sot (Thailand).
Those in Thailand on a visa run can cross to Kawthaung but cannot venture farther into Myanmar."
[261] Expansions were expected in September 2013, but yet again are mainly Thai and other Asian-based airlines according to Eleven Media Group 's Eleven , "Thailand-based Nok Air and Business Airlines and Singapore-based Tiger Airline ". [261] Economic sanctions [ edit ] The Government of Myanmar was under economic sanctions by the US Treasury Department (31 CFR Part 537, 16 August 2005) [262] and by Executive orders 13047 (1997), [263] 13310 (2003), [263] 13448 (2007), [263] 13464 (2008), [263] and the most recent, 13619 (2012).
[265] [266] From May 2012 to February 2013, the United States began to lift its economic sanctions on Myanmar "in response to the historic reforms that have been taking place in that country."
[269] During her first official visit to Washington, D.C. in September 2016, Myanmar's State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi met with US President Barack Obama , who announced that long-standing trade sanctions against Myanmar are to be lifted, adding, "It is the right thing to do to ensure the people of Burma see rewards from a new way of doing business, and a new government."
[270] Government stakeholders in business [ edit ] Main article: Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings The military has the majority stakeholder position in all of the major industrial corporations of the country (from oil production and consumer goods to transportation and tourism).
[275] In December 2014, Myanmar signed an agreement to set up its first stock exchange.
First Myanmar Investment Co., Ltd.
[276] Units of measurement [ edit ] Main article: Burmese units of measurement According to The World Factbook, Myanmar is one of three countries along with Liberia and the United States that has not adopted the International System of Units (SI) metric system as their official system of weights and measures.
[277] The common units of measure are unique to Myanmar, but the government web pages use both imperial units [278] and metric units.
[281] Society [ edit ] Demographics [ edit ] Main article: Demographics of Myanmar A block of flats in down-town Yangon, facing Bogyoke Market .
The provisional results of the 2014 Myanmar Census show that the total population is 51,419,420.
There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, and millions more work illegally.
Myanmar's fertility rate as of 2011 [update] is 2.23, which is slightly above replacement level [285] and is low compared to Southeast Asian countries of similar economic standing, such Cambodia (3.18) and Laos (4.41).
The first is economic hardship, which results in the delay of marriage and family-building; [287] the average age of marriage in Myanmar is 27.5 for men, 26.4 for women.

Myanmar is ethnically diverse.
While it is extremely difficult to verify this statement, there are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar, consisting mainly of distinct Tibeto-Burman peoples, but with sizeable populations of Tai–Kadai , Hmong–Mien, and Austroasiatic (Mon–Khmer) peoples.
[291] [292] Myanmar's ethnic minority groups prefer the term "ethnic nationality" over "ethnic minority" as the term "minority" furthers their sense of insecurity in the face of what is often described as "Burmanisation"—the proliferation and domination of the dominant Bamar culture over minority cultures.
It is estimated that 52,000 Anglo-Burmese remain in Myanmar.
Conservative estimates state that there are over 295,800 minority refugees from Myanmar, with the majority being Rohingya , Karen , and Karenni are principally located along the Thai-Myanmar border.
[294] There are nine permanent refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of which were established in the mid-1980s.
Many Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar.
[300] Languages [ edit ] Main article: Languages of Myanmar Myanmar is home to four major language families: Sino-Tibetan , Tai–Kadai , Austro-Asiatic , and Indo-European .
Mon , Palaung , and Wa are the major Austroasiatic languages spoken in Myanmar.
Burmese , the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Myanmar, is related to Tibetan and Chinese .
Religion [ edit ] Main article: Religion in Myanmar Religion in Burma ( 2014 Myanmar Census ) [305] [nb 2] Buddhism    87.9%
Many religions are practised in Myanmar.
[306] Such persecution and targeting of civilians is particularly notable in Eastern Myanmar, where over 3000 villages have been destroyed in the past ten years.
[313] According to 2014 Myanmar Census , 87.9% of the population identifies as Buddhists.
[320] Although Hinduism is practised by 0.5% of the population, it was a major religion in Myanmar's past.
Health [ edit ] Main article: Health in Myanmar The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor.
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Myanmar is 240.
Myanmar's government spends the least percentage of its GDP on health care of any country in the world, and international donor organisations give less to Myanmar, per capita, than any other country except India.

More The Republic of the Union of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is the second largest country in Southeast Asia and boasts a population of more than 50 million.
Myanmar emerged from British colonial rule in 1948, and remained under military control long after General Ne Win overthrew the civilian government in a 1962 coup.
Starting in 2010, Myanmar’s military began to adopt gradual reforms that moved the country closer to a liberal democratic system, eventually releasing thousands of political prisoners, including dissident leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi .
In November, 2015, Myanmar held what were widely viewed as its first open elections, marking a landslide victory for the party of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
